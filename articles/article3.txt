ABSTRACT
We present an instrument that uses a novel technique to render topographical maps of microscopic reflecting surfaces
in which depth resolution can be an order or magnitude or more better than the lateral resolution of the confocal microscope.
In a confocal scanning reflected-light microscope, the illumination light coming out of the objective is a cone of light with its
axis parallel to the optical axis and focused into a diffraction-limited spot. If the specimen is smooth within the size of the spot,
then the laws of reflection apply. When the reflecting surface is perpendicular to the optical axis, the reflected light is a cone
that coincides with the illumination light. If the reflecting surface is not perpendicular to the optical axis, the axis of the
reflected cone of light is at an angle with respect to the optical axis equal to twice the tilt angle of the surface and oriented in
the direction of the surface tilt. Because of this tilt, a portion of the back focal plane (BFP) of the objective does not receive
any of the reflected light, while in the diametrically opposite side, the aperture stop blocks part of the reflected light. For a
given illumination profile, the distribution of light on the BFP is determined by the tilt and orientation angles of the reflecting
surface and thus can be used to recover these angles for each pixel in the specimen. These angles are then used to render a
topographical map of the reflecting surface.

1. INTRODUCTION
There exist several instruments capable of producing topographical maps or surface profiles of specimens. These
profilometers are based on different principles and have different capabilities and limitations. In particular the transmission
electron microscope (TEM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM), scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and near-field
scanning optical microscope (NSOM) capable of resolution in the sub-micrometer range. All four instruments, however, are
limited to imaging the most superficial layer of the specimen. Any material above the structure of interest has to be removed or
etched-out to allow observation. The STM and NSOM use probes that have to be almost in contact with the surface of interest.
The size of this probe makes it impossible to image trough-shaped structures smaller than the probe. There are optical profilometers that scan the illumination spot. The reflected light differential phase contrast microscope5 uses scanning illumination
and detects the light with two detectors in the back focal plane (BFP) of the objective, each detector covers half of the BFP.
The instrument is based in the fact that a cone of light that illuminates the specimen is reflected at an angle when the illuminated spot or tile is not perpendicular to the optical axis. The tilt angle of the reflecting tile is then calculated from the difference between the intensities collected by each detector and used to calculate the surface profile of the reflecting specimen. This
instrument is limited to recording tilt angles in only one direction, and only angles within half the NA give rise to unambiguous signals. There are interference profilometers such as described in8,10,20,21, and22. These instruments are based on making
two interferometric measurements, one is used as a reference while the other is probing. The resolution of these instruments is
limited either by microphonics (modulation of the laser beams by acoustic noise) or by the size of the probing spot, which in
some cases is as large as 3µm. The interference profilometer described in 21,22 works around the microphonics by making the
two interferometers share a common optical path and thus any phase variations induced by microphonics are common to both
beams and they can be canceled out. The laser feedback microscope (LFM)23 is a confocal scanning interference profilometer
that uses the interference between a reference beam and a reflected beam to determine height within the depth of focus of the
microscope and uses a confocal aperture to reject out of focus reflections. Wyco Corporation (Tucson, AZ) manufactures an
interference profilometer, the WYCO RST, that uses short-coherence-length white light and thus uses a tungsten lamp instead
of a laser. This profilometer is presumedly capable of optical axis resolution of 3nm over a range of up to 100 micrometers.
The instrument, however, has an interferometer between the objective and the specimen and thus is limited to using long work-

ing distance, low NA (NA < 0.5) dry objectives that severely limit its lateral resolution. The profilometer is further limited to
slope angles of less than 14 degrees (half the angle of the 0.5 NA dry objective).
In addition, there are reflected-light scanning profilometers that use two confocal apertures and two light detectors,
one behind each pinhole aperture6,10. The confocal apertures are located near, but not exactly at, conjugate image planes. The
apertures are slightly out of focus by the same distance but in opposite directions. If the reflecting tile in the specimen is in
focus, the two detectors record the same light intensity. If the specimen is moved away from focus the intensity at one detector
increases while the intensity at the other decreases. The difference between the signals from the two detectors is used in a
feedback control loop that translates the stage until the reflecting tile is in focus. The confocal apertures may be either
pinholes6 or slits10. The reported axial resolution of these instruments is about 0.1 µm with a 0.85 NA objective lens.
There are profilometers in which a regular grid is projected from an angle into the specimen. Because of the different
heights of different tiles in the specimen, the reflected grid is deformed with respect to the projected grid. The amount and
direction of grid deformation is used to obtain the height of each tile. These instruments have more application for macroscopic than for microscopic profilometry, first, because two separate lenses are necessary, one to project the grid and one to
record the reflected image, and second, because the resolution is limited by the size of the grid.
In this article we present a new reflected light scanning confocal profilometer that obtains the tilt and orientation
angles of each reflecting tile in the specimen by recording information about the distribution of reflected light in the BFP of the
objective lens. This angular information is then used to obtain topographical maps or surface profiles of the reflecting specimen. The profilometer presented here has several advantages over the instruments described above. First, it can record information not only about the most superficial layer of the specimen, but also about layers within the specimen. Second, it neither
relies on the coherence of light nor uses a reference beam and, thus, is immune to microphonics and thermal expansion. Third,
it does not require a special objective and can be used with very high NA/high magnification objectives, thus has a better lateral resolution than many of the present optical profilometers. Fourth, it can record tilt angles in any direction and up to the
full NA angle of the objective, not only to half the NA angle. Fifth, the profilometer records also the orientation angle thus
allowing rendering a 2D map of pixel heights. The profilometer presented here is capable of very high depth resolution, in the
order of tenths of nm or less. The lateral resolution, however is still limited by diffraction. Most of the theory presented here
is described in a U.S. patent1 but is presented here for completeness.
The article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background material that lead to the development of the instrument. Section 3 describes the reflected light profilometer, including the hardware and computational methods necessary to
obtain topographical maps of reflecting surfaces. Sections 4 describes our data collection and handling procedure and presents
topographical maps obtained from this instrument. Finally Section 5 summarizes our conclusions and presents some directions for future research.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Specular reflection through a microscope.
If a microscopical specimen displays a significant change in refractive index over a depth that is less than about half
the wavelength of light, and if the surface of the specimen is “smooth” i.e its slope does not change significantly over a region
comparable in size to the wavelength of light, then the laws of reflection hold exactly (i.e. the angle of reflection is equal to the
angle of incidence, and the intensity of the reflection follows Fresnell’s equations). In this case the specimen produces a specular reflection2. If a plane wave illuminates a reflecting surface whose area is larger than the Airy disk, then the reflected wave
will have a preferred direction of propagation as predicted by the laws of reflection. Conversely, if the entire reflecting surface
is smaller than the diffraction limited spot, then the reflected wave will be almost a spherical wave, i.e. its amplitude is the
same in all directions and thus independent of the tilt angle of the reflecting surface.
In a confocal scanning microscope that uses a single illuminating spot to scan the specimen the exit pupil (ExP) is
filled by either a spherical or a plane wave that is focused by the objective into a diffraction limited spot in the specimen. If the
specimen is a flat surface (Figure 1, right) perpendicular to the optical axis it will reflect a pencil of rays that propagates to the
objective and fills the ExP. On the image side of the objective the reflected light is focused into a point at the aerial image plane
(where the confocal aperture is located). If the reflecting surface is at an angle (but in focus) (Figure 1, left) the reflected pencil
will also be at an angle and will not fill the ExP of the objective. In a paraxial approximation the portion of the ExP illuminated
by the reflected light is the area common to two circles, the ExP and an eccentric image of the ExP. In general the reflected

light pencil is a cone with its axis at an angle equal to twice the tilt angle of the surface. The intersection of this cone with the
BFP is a conic section. Light passes only through that portion of the ExP which intersects this conic section. The axis of symmetry of this conic section is an indication of the orientation of the reflecting surface or tile. The degree of eccentricity of the
conic section with respect to the ExP is a measure of the tilt angle of the tile, the larger the angle, the more eccentric the ExP
image is. As long as the tile is tilted less than the NA angle, some of the reflected light passes through the ExP and propagates
beyond the BFP converging to a point in the aerial image plane and then diverging again. At some distance behind the aerial
image plane the structure of the ExP can be observed again (within an inversion and a possible change of size). This conjugate
ExP (CExP) through the confocal aperture will thus contain information about the tilt angle and orientation of the reflecting
surface.
As it is known, the light reflecting from an out of focus surface perpendicular to the optical axis will be focused into a
point in the optical axis either in front or behind the confocal aperture. In this case the ExP of the objective may or may not be
filled depending on the location of the surface relative to the in-focus plane. If the out-of-focus surface is closer to the objective than the in focus plane, the ExP is not fully illuminated. If the reflecting surface is farther away from the objective than
the in-focus plane, the ExP is fully illuminated but the light intensity is somewhat reduced relative to the in-focus case because
part of the reflected pencil of rays is blocked by the objective’s aperture stop. If the out-of-focus surface is not perpendicular
to the optical axis the image of the scanning spot not only is at a plane other than the aerial image plane, but is also off axis
(Figure 2.). Because the reflected pencil of rays does not converge to the confocal aperture two things happen. First the light
intensity at any plane behind the aperture is reduced relative to the in focus case and second the structure of the ExP is not preserved behind this aperture. Thus the light distribution in the ExP or CExP contains information about the tilt and orientation
only for the part of the specimen that is in focus. By recording the structure of the light distribution the ExP or CExP for each
pixel (x, y) the tilt (γ) and orientation (φ) angles of the reflecting tile can be obtained. Under the assumption that adjacent tiles
in the image are connected, these angles can be used to render a topographical map of the reflecting surface. In Section 3.1 we
describe possible methods to record information about the light distribution in the ExP or CExP sufficient to uniquely determine the tilt and orientation angles of the reflecting tile. Then, in Section 3.2 we describe how these angles can be obtained
from the recorded information. In Section 3.4 we present a method to obtain a topographical map from these angles.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROFILOMETER
3.1 Structure of the ExP
The structure of the illuminated portion of ExP or CExP therefore is an indication of the tilt and orientation of the
reflecting surface at the location of the scanning spot. The direction of the reflection can be defined by the tilt and orientation

angles. As mentioned above, the illuminated portion of the ExP is part of an eccentric conic section: the direction of the eccentricity is a direct read on the orientation of the reflected wave and the amount of eccentricity shows the tilt angle. Using
reflected light image theory and the structure of the ExP or CExP we can obtain, for each object pixel, the tilt and orientation
angles (or equivalently the slopes in two non-parallel directions). With this information and assuming that adjacent pixels are
physically connected, we construct a topographical map of the reflecting surface. There are several ways to record information
about the light distribution in the ExP or CExP. The most obvious way would be to place a spatially-resolved detector (e.g. a
video camera or a CCD camera) in a plane conjugate to the BFP to collect an image of the reflected light distribution in this
plane. This image would then be used to obtain the tilt and orientation angles of the corresponding pixel. This approach, however, would require processing a very large amount of information because one image of the CBFP needs to be collected for
every pixel in the specimen. Fortunately it is not necessary to record a full image of the BFP to obtain sufficient information to
obtain the tilt and orientation angles of the reflecting tile.
The light coming through the pinhole aperture that reaches the PMT has within it the spatial information to create a
topographic map of the optical section being imaged. The problem is that a single-PMT detector integrates all the incoming
light. However, adding a mask in front of the detector that blocks all the light except for that reaching the detector from one
direction (e.g. a pie-shaped wedge aperture) would allow the detector to sample only the light from one orientation. A number
of orientations may be sampled for each pixel or tile in the specimen by rotating the detector mask and collecting a new image
after each rotation. As the rotation takes place the light intensity for a given tile will vary in several ways. These profiles (a
stream of intensities as the aperture rotates) can be easily used to assess the orientation of the tile being illuminated. Thus, a
rapid rotation of a pie-shaped wedge will give a data stream that can be analyzed to determine orientation and tilt angle. Other
rotating aperture geometries with subtle advantages and disadvantages are also possible (e.g. parallel slit, half circle).
The mask may be placed in front of behind the confocal aperture, but because diffraction at the confocal pinhole
could potentially degrade the structure of the ExP, there is an advantage in placing this mask in front of the confocal pinhole at
a plane conjugate to the ExP. This mask must be only on the path of the return light as shown in Figure 3. As the aperture
scans the ExP, information about tilt and orientation is recorded for each pixel. Out-of-focus pixels are filtered out by the confocal pinhole. Although the mask can have almost any shape, it is simpler to use a wedge shaped aperture. By rotating this
aperture we collect information about the ExP that uniquely determines the tilt and orientation angles of the reflecting tile. In
the tests we have done so far the wedge angle is either 60o or 180o and six images are collected with aperture rotations of 60o
although other wedge angles and/or overlapping rotations are also possible. By rotating the wedge aperture at a CBFP wa
record, for each pixel (x, y), a series of intensities {Ij(xs, ys); j = 0, 1, …, Nd - 1}, where Nd is the number of rotations of the
wedge aperture necessary to cover the ExP.

3.2 Obtaining tilt and orientation from the recorded intensities
Once a series of measurements {Ij(xs, ys); j = 0, 1, …, Nd - 1} has been collected it is necessary to obtain the tilt and
orientation angles (γs,φs) (or slopes) for each pixel (xs,ys) in the specimen. This inverse problem may be addressed in any one
of several possible ways. In principle, it is possible to find two expressions or functions φr = Φ(I) and γr = Γ(I) for I = {I0, I1,
…, I N – 1 } and simply substituting the recorded intensities. Another possibility is to find Nd analytic expressions or funcd
tions Ij = Ij(γs,φs); j = 0, 1, …, Nd - 1, that relate the Nd intensities to the recorded angles and solve them numerically for
(γs,φs). However, the derivation of either φr = Φ(I) and γr = Γ(I) or Ij = Ij(γs,φs), j = 0, 1, …, Nd - 1, from optical principles
has proven very difficult. Furthermore, these approaches require knowing the microscope setup to a good degree of precision,
including the spatially varying attenuation at the acousto optic light deflector in the Noran confocal we have used, the intensity
profile of the laser beam, any astigmatism in the optical layout, …. Another possibility is to find a calibration curves or look
up table (LUT), i.e., a table of the light intensity collected at each rotation of the wedge aperture for each combination of tilt
and orientation angle of the reflecting tile, and then using this LUT to obtain the tilt and orientation angles (or slopes) of each
pixel in the image. The LUT can be calculated from optical principles or experimentally determined. The theoretical calculation,. however, has the drawback that it also requires accurate knowledge of the microscope setup. Below we describe how to
obtain this LUT experimentally.

Experimental determination of the LUT
The LUT may be experimentally determined by collecting the images of a calibrated target or of a specimen whose
size and shape are well known. A possible calibrated target is a flat surface that can be tilted and rotate. With this target, however, the user must collect one image for each entry in the LUT, thus recording a LUT with fine granularity would be tedious
and time consuming. Furthermore, most high NA objectives have short working distances, typically less than one millimeter.
If the target is larger that this working distance, it would be impossible to tilt it to the full range of angles accepted by the
objective without the target hitting the objective.

An alternative to using a calibrated target is to use an object whose size and shape are well known and that displays
all the tilt and orientation angles within the range of the objective. One possibility is to use microspheres or beads, for example latex beads. The beads have a known shape (are spherical) and have areas at tilt an orientation angles over the whole set
{(γ, φ); 0 ≤ γ≤ π/2, 0 ≤ φ < 2π}, and thus cover a wider range of angles than any objective can collect. The size of the bead
must satisfy two conflicting requirements. First, the bead must be small enough so that all the tilt angles collected by the
objective are within a single optical section. This is, the spherical cap {0 ≤ γ≤ γΝΑ}, where γΝΑ is the acceptance angle of the
objective, must be within a single optical section. Second, the bead must be large enough so that an area of size comparable to
the diffraction limited spot can be considered planar. If the bead is too large, then several optical sections must be collected
from the same bead and then merged into a single image. If the bead is too small, then second order effects become important,
i.e. the curvature of the reflecting surface has a non-negligible effect on the reflected-light distribution.
Latex beads may show small irregularities that would lead to an erroneous LUT. To work around this potential problem, we average the images of several beads, say Nb. These images consist of the Nd positions of the wedge aperture, an image
collected with the BFP mask removed from the return light path, and an image collected through the fluorescent channel. The
fluorescent image should be focused in the equator of the beads to be able to determine the size and approximate center of each
of the Nb beads from this image. The approximate center is necessary to be able to align the Nb images. For this alignment,
we propose using the center of brightness of the bead defined as

∫ xI op ( x, y ) dx dy

∫ yI op ( x, y ) dx dy

I
I
, y b = ----------------------------------------x b = ----------------------------------------∫ I op ( x, y ) dx dy
∫ I op ( x, y ) dx dy
I

(1)

I

where Iop(x, y) is the either intensity of the reflected-light image collected with the BFP mask removed, of the intensity of the
fluorescent image. Next, the Nb images of the beads are aligned by shifting the center of brightness of each bead to the center
of the image (xc, yc). Because the center of brightness defined in Equation (1) is unlikely to have integer values, subpixel
shifts are likely to be necessary. For this subpixel shifts we simply use a bilinear interpolation from the 4 surrounding pixels.
Finally, the aligned images are averaged into a single image that is used to obtain the intensity vs. tilt and orientation angles
table.
The tilt and orientation angles of a pixel can be determined from the position of the pixel relative to the center of the
averaged image from simple geometrical construction. The orientation φs of the normal to the bead’s surface is simply

( x – xc)
φ s = arctan -------------------( y – yc)

(2)

where (xc, yc) is the geometric center of the bead and the arctan function is a four-quadrant tan-1 function, i.e. the signs of
numerator and denominator of its argument are considered separately. If

r =

( x – xc) 2 + ( y – yc) 2

(3)

is the distance from the pixel to the center of the averaged image, the tilt angle γs of the normal to the bead at a point r pixels
away from the center of the bead is
γs = sin-1(r/R)
(4)
where R is the radius of the bead measured in pixels (it is therefore not necessary to know the actual bead radius or the pixel
size).

3.3 Obtaining tilt and orientation from the LUT

Scanning the LUT
The method that we are currently using to invert the LUT is, for every pixel in the image, to scan the entries in the
table to find the one that best matches the recorded intensities for that pixel. The best match is defined by the entry of the LUT
that is closest to recorded intensities where the distance is defined from the difference between the recorded intensities and the
intensities on the LUT using either the two-norm (or Euclidean norm)

of this difference. The former leads to a least squared-error criterion and the later leads to a least absolute-error criterion for
the best match. The easiest, but slowest, way to scan the LUT for the best match is exhaustive scanning, i.e. to visit every
entry of the LUT and compute the distance between the intensities in the LUT and the recorded intensities. Because the table
must be scanned for every pixel in the image, this approach is rather impractical for routine use. To speed up the process, the
LUT could be scanned in steps, increasing the resolution of the scan at each step. In this approach, the first time the LUT is
scanned, not every entry is visited, instead, every 2nd or every 4th value of tilt (and orientation) is visited. This coarser scan
takes 1/4 or 1/16 of the time of a full scan. After finding the tilt and orientation that minimize the distance at this resolution,
the entries of the LUT neighboring these tilt and orientation are scanned to refine the resolution.

Minimization based on the LUT
Another possible way to invert the LUT is to make an educated guess for the tilt and orientation angles based on the
Nd recorded intensities and to use a gradient descent method to search for the minimum of either d2 (Equation (5)) or d1 (Equation (6)). The LUT is used to compute an approximation to the gradient using a finite difference approximation to the derivatives. When the initial guess is close to the correct value of tilt and orientation, this method quickly finds the tilt and
orientation that minimize either d1 or d2. In this method, however, the initial guess plays a critical role. For most of the possible combinations of recorded intensities {Ii; i = 0, 1, …, Nd-1}, Equations (5) and (6) have several local minima. Thus, if the
initial guess for tilt and orientation is closer to a local minimum than to the global minimum, the minimization will be
“trapped” in the nearest local minimum.
For low NA objectives the largest intensity is recorded when the line that bisects the wedge aperture is aligned with
the orientation angle of the reflecting tile. We take advantage of this fact to obtain the initial guess orientation angle φ, For
each pixel in the image we calculate the discrete Fourier transform of the Nd recorded intensities and use the phase of the fundamental frequency component as the initial guess. For large NA objectives, however, there is a range of tilt angles for which
the largest intensity is recorded when the bisectrix of the wedge aperture is in the direction opposite to the orientation of the
reflecting tile. In this case the initial guess for the orientation angle should be a 180o away from the phase of the fundamental
frequency component. To avoid this ambiguity, in our current implementation we use both values as initial guesses and find
which one of the two leads to the smaller distance (Equation (5) or (6)).

3.4 Profile from tilt and orientation (or slopes).
Once the tilt and orientation angles are known for every pixel in the image, it is possible to obtain the topographical
map of the reflecting surface. Before computing the topographical map, the slopes in two orthogonal directions are calculated
from the tilt and orientation as

∂z
∂z
----- = – tan γ cos φ and ----- = – tan γ sin φ .
∂x
∂y

(7)

Notice the point γ = π/2 where tanγ diverges is not within the range of tilt angles collected by any objective and thus the slopes
are always finite.

The integrability problem.
After the slopes in two orthogonal directions are calculated, the topographical map of the reflecting surface is easily
calculated. Without loss of generality, we assume that the slopes are calculated along the horizontal and vertical directions (x
and y axes). Then, if the slopes at column i, row j of the image are
∂z
∂z
and h i, j = ----,
g i, j = ----∂ x ( i, j )
∂y ( i, j )
then, to a first-order approximation, the height z at pixel (i, j) can be calculated either as

Conchello, Heym, Wei, and Lichtman

(8)

z i, j ≅ z i, j – 1 + ∆yh i, j – 1

(9)

or as
where ∆x and ∆y are the pixel sizes in the horizontal and vertical directions. Unfortunately, Equations (8) and (9) will seldom
give the same value for zi,j. This is a well known problem in shape-from-shading algorithms called the integrability problem.
One cause of the integrability problem is that Equations (8) and (9) are first order approximations that are exact only if the
reflecting surface is a plane or if ∆x and ∆y approach zero. Another cause is that, even when Equations (8) and (9) are exact,
there is measurement noise and thus the slopes gi,j and hi,j are never exact. Using only either Equation (8) or Equation (9), as is
necessary in the single-direction profilometer of Atkinson4,5, does not work around the integrability problem. For example,
suppose that Equation (9) is used to calculate the surface height along two adjacent rows, j and j+1 each with Nx pixels. Each
pixel height zi+1,j is calculated from its immediately preceding neighbor zi,j. If zi,j has some error, zi+1,j will have the cumulative effects of this error and any error resulting from Equation (9) (either from measurement error or from using a first order
approximation). Likewise zi+2,j will have the cumulative effects of errors in zi+1,j, zi,j, gi+1,j, and gi,j. This error accumulation
propagates all across row j, and thus z N , j will have the accumulated error of all other pixels in the row. Similarly, z N , j + 1
x
x
will have the accumulated error of all other pixels in row j+1. Because the errors at each row are likely to be different and
because of to the cumulative effect of the errors, the final pixel heights in rows j and j+1, z N , j and z N , j + 1, are likely to be
x
x
significantly different.
Another drawback of line-by-line integration of the slopes is that in a typical image there are a large number of dark
pixels. These pixels correspond to portions of the specimen that either are out of focus or have tilt angles larger than γNA. Outof-focus pixels are dark because most of the light reflected off these pixels is rejected by the confocal aperture. Pixels with tilt
angles larger than γNA reflect all the light at angles larger than γNA, and thus all the light reflected of these pixels misses the
objective’s exit pupil. The out-of-focus pixels may not be a problem if enough optical slices are collected to include the whole
depth of the specimen. Unfortunately, pixels with large tilt angles are out of the range of measurable slopes and they appear
dark in all optical sections. At the dark pixels, the tilt and orientation information is missing and thus the assumption that each
pixel is connected to its next neighbor is violated. Line-by-line integration can be applied only if the image region is simplyconnected and convex (Figure 4), this is if the image region does not have holes or gulfs, and even in those cases, adjacent
lines can have similar topography only if the region is a 2D interval, i.e. a rectangular region with its sides parallel to the x and
y axes. For an arbitrary simply-connected convex region, however, the height along one line is very likely to be significantly
offset relative to the adjacent lines because they have different starting points.

are convex and thus line-by-line integration may be done. I3, however is not a 2D interval and thus topographical maps
calculated with line-by-line integration along adjacent lines are likely to be significantly offset from one another.

the surface profile using a least squares approach. For multiply-connected regions we calculate the topographical map of each
one of the simply-connected image regions or islands. That is, for each island In we define the sum of squared errors as
ε =

{ ( z i – 1, j + ∆ xg i – 1, j – z i, j ) + ( z i, j – 1 + ∆ yh i, j – 1 – z i, j ) }

(10)

and find the set of surface heights {zi,j} that makes ε a minimum. To obtain this minimum we follow the standard procedure of
setting
∂ε
(11)
----------- = 0 ∀ ( i, j ) ∈ I n
∂z i, j
and solving for zi,j. Equation (11) leads to a linear system of equations of the form
Az = h
(12)
where A is an N×N matrix of constant coefficients, z is a vector containing the N surface heights zi,j in lexicographical ordering, h is a N-element vector whose elements depend on gi,j∆x and hi,j∆y, and N is the number of pixels in the image island.
The slopes provide information about the height of a pixel relative to its neighbors, thus in Equation (12) there is one pixel
height that can be arbitrarily chosen.
Equation (11) can be solved using any one of a number of numerical methods. Matrix A has one row for each pixel in
the image and thus has a very large order. Fortunately, each row has at most 5 non-zero entries. This is because in Equation
(10) each pixel zi,j depends only on its immediate neighbors zi±1,j±1, and each pixel can have at most four immediate neighbors
(boundary pixels have less than four neighbors). Thus, it is convenient to use iterative methods to solve Equation (11). In particular, we use Gauss-Seidel iteration method24. The Gauss-Seidel method has a slow global convergence rate. To accelerate
its convergence rate we use the standard method of successive over relaxation (SOR)25. The SOR method accelerates the global convergence by an order of magnitude, however, the local convergence rate varies greatly across the pixels in an island.
Pixels that are close to the first pixel reach their final value much faster than pixels that are further from this first pixel. To
accelerate the local convergence rate we use another standard technique in which the direction of the raster scan is alternated
between iterations, the so-called alternating-direction iterative (ADI) method26.

4. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND RESULTS
We tested the profilometer with an object of known shape. We imaged a 1 mm diameter ball bearing using a 10×/0.25
NA dry objective. With this low NA objective, only a shallow cap of the sphere (7µm deep) is within the range of tilt angles
than can be recorded by our profilometer. Figure 5 shows the collected images and a shadowcast rendering of the ball bearing.
The six imges on the top frame were collected rotating a 60o pie shaped aperutre with 60o steps. The information collected
was then used to extract the tilt and orientation angles for each pixel in the ball bearing. This anglular information was then
used to render shadowcast images of the ballbearing. These images, shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5, were calculated by
assigning to each pixel an intensity proportional to the cosine of the angle between the normal to the pixel and the line from the
pixel to a simulated light source. The dark areas in the images are parts of the ball bearing whose tilt angle is larger than the
NA-angle (14.5o) and thus non of the light reflected off these areas is collected by the objective. Although the spherical cap is
shalower than the axial resolution of a 0.25 NA lens (which is about 32 times the wavelength), the profilomter was able to
resolve detail within the 7 µm depth of the cap.
For test purposes siliceous diatoms have proven to be ideal subjects for reflected light profilometry. Diatoms have
skeletons whose refractive indexes differ enough from water to yield a strong reflective signal even when immersed. Because
no special preparation is required to successfully image diatoms using reflected light, they are extremely convenient test
objects. In addition Carolina Biological Supply Company offers exhibition slides containing over 50 species permitting easy
access to many species in this topographically diverse family of micro-organisms. The three dimensional intricacy of diatoms
is exceptional and thus they serve as excellent tests of the axial resolving power of the profilometry technique. In addition
many diatoms have been studied by SEM27. The SEM images provide a powerful check on the accuracy of the technique. We
have also used less intrinsically reflective biological material. For example, we stained for reflected light the acetylcholine
receptor laden postsynaptic membrane of muscle fibers with the reaction product of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using a
standard avidin biotin approach.
One diatom we have studied in detail is Auliscus sculptus found on Carolina Biological slide K3-B25N. We imaged
the diatom using a 100 X 1.4 NA plan apo objective (Nikon) using a laser scanning confocal apparatus (Odyssey, Noran
Instruments, Madison, WI) attached to an upright microscope (Optiphot-2, Nikon Instruments). This confocal instrument was

modified (with the help of Noran Instruments) so that the return light path was directed outside the enclosed instrument giving
us access to a conjugate of the exit pupil. At this position we placed a rotating pie-shaped (60o) wedge aperture. Beyond this
plane the light re-converged to an aerial image plane where a pinhole aperture was positioned. The photomultiplier was placed
beyond the pinhole. Because the diatom's surface extended over a depth of greater than 5 µm we obtained a z-axis stack at six
image depths (0.75 µm steps). At each depth we obtained six images of the diatom (one for each position of the wedge). Thus
a total of 36 images were obtained (six images/plane × six planes). For each pixel, the plane yielding the brightest total
reflected signal is selected to be in the composite image.
Shown in Figure 6 is the reconstruction based on a theoretical LUT. This image is comparable to the SEM image
obtained of a related species (Auliscus cylindricus 27). In order to view the surface features with high sensitivity we have in
this case intentionally increased the magnification of the z axis in comparison to the xy planes.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS OF FUTURE WORK
We have developed an instrument for reflected light profilometry that is capable of high axial resolution. The instrument overcomes the limitations existing profilometers: First, it is not limited to imaging only the most superficial layer of a
specimen. Second, although it uses laser illumination, it does not rely on the coherence of the laser and thus is not limited by
microphonics (modulation of the laser light by acoustic noise). Third, it can use very high NA objectives and thus has a very
high lateral resolution. Fourth, it does not use a probe and thus can be used to image trough-like structures. The results presented here are very encouraging, however, there is more research to be done. First, we do not know yet what the depth resolution limit is or what limits it. Second, we have used only two shapes for rotating aperture (180o and 60o) and only one
rotational step (60o). We have not found a striking difference between the results obtained with one and the other. The optimal
combination of aperture size and rotational step has yet to be determined.
