A. Bruckstein

Abstract
This short paper surveys methods for planar shape smoothing and processing
and planar shape recognition invariant under viewing distortions and even
partial occlusions. It is argued that all the results available in the literature
on these problems implicitly follow from successfully addressing two basic
problems: invariant location of points with respect to a given shape (a given
set of points in the plane) and invariant displacement of points with regard to
the given shape.

Introduction

Vision is an extremely complex process aimed at extracting useful information
from images: recognizing three-dimensional shapes from their two-dimensional
projections, evaluating distances and depths and spatial relationships between objects are tantamount to what we commonly mean by seeing. In spite of some
irresponsible promises, made by computer scientists in the early 60's, that within
a decade computers will be able "to see", we are not even close today to having machines that can recognize objects in images the way even the youngest of
children are capable to do. As a scientific and technological challenge, the process of vision has taught us a lesson in modesty: we are indeed quite limited in
what we can accomplish in this domain, even if we call to arms deep mathematical results and deploy amazingly fast and powerfiil electronic computing devices.
In order to address some practical technological image analysis questions and
in order to appreciate the complexity of the issues involved in "seeing" it helps
to consider simplified vision problems such as "character recognition" and other
"model-based planar shape recognition" problems and see how far our theories

(i.e. our "brain-power") and experiments (or our "number-crunching power") can
take us toward working systems that accomplish useful image analysis tasks. As
a result of such scientific and commercial efforts we do have a few vision systems
that work and there is a vast literature in the "hot" field of computer vision dealing
with representation, approximation, completion, enhancement, smoothing, exaggeration, characterization and recognition of planar shapes. This paper surveys
methods for planar shape recognition and processing (smoothing, enhancement,
exaggeration etc.) invariant under distortions that occur when looking at planar
shapes from various points of view. These distortions are the Euclidean, Similarity, Affine and Projective maps of the plane to itself and model the possible
viewing projections of the plane where a shape is assumed to reside into the image plane of a pinhole camera, that captures the shape from arbitrary locations. A
further problem one must often deal with when looking at shapes is occlusion. If
several planar shapes are superimposed in the plane or are floating in 3D-space
they can and will (fully, or partially) occlude each other. Under full occlusion
there is of course no hope for recognition, but how about partial occlusion? Can
we recognize a planar shape from a partial glimpse of its contour? Is there enough
information in a portion of the projection of a planar shape to enable its recognition? We shall here address such questions too. The main goal of this paper will
be to point out that all methods proposed to address the above mentioned topics
implicitly require the solution of two fundamental problems: distortion-invariant
location of points with respect to given planar shape (which for our purposes can
be a planar region with curved or polygonal boundaries or in fact an arbitrary set
of points) and invariant displacement, motion or relocation of points with respect
to the given shape.

11.2 Invariant Point Locations and Displacements
A planar shape S, for our purpose, will be a set of points in R? points that most
often specify a connected a planar region with a boundary that is either smooth or
polygonal. The viewing distortions are classes of transformations 1/^ : R'^ —> R^
parameterized by a set of values </>, and, while the class of transformations is
assumed to be known to us, the exact values of the parameters are not. The classes
of transformations considered are continuous groups of transformations modeling
various imaging modalities, the important examples being:
• The Euclidean motions (parameterized by a rotation angle 9 and a twodimensional translation vector (tx.ty), i.e. (j) has 3 parameters).

Given a planar shape S C R"^ and a class of viewing distortions V^ : R"^
we consider the following problem:

R^

Two observers A and B look at SA = V^^ (5) and at SB = V<f>B {^) respectively without knowing (j)^ and (J)B- In other words A and B look at S from
different points of view and the details of their camera location orientation and
settings are unknown to them (See Figure 11.1). Observer A chooses a point
PA in its image plane R^, and wants to describe its location w.r.t. V^^ (5) to
observer B, in order to enable him to locate the corresponding point PB —
y<t>Biy;^{PA))- A knows that B looks at SB = V^s{S) =
V^siVi^'iSA)),
but this is all the information available to A and B. How should A describe the
location of P ^ w.r.t. SA to JB?
Solving this problem raises the issue of characterizing a position (PA) in the
plane of SA in a way that is invariant to the class of transformations V$.
Let us consider a very simple example: take 5 be a set of indistinguishable points
in the plane {Pi,P2,... ,PN} and V^ be the class of EucHdean motions. A
new point P should be described to observers of this point constellation, under
arbitrary viewing distortions K^, i.e. observers of
K^{Pi,...,p^} = {y^(Pi),y^(P2)...v4Piv)}
so that they will be able to locate V(f>{P) in their respective "images". How should
we do this? Well, we shall have to describe P ' s location w.r.t. {Pi, P 2 , . . . , P/v } in
an Euclidean-invariant way. We know from elementary geometry that Euclidean
motions preserve lengths and angles between line segments so there are several
ways to provide invariant coordinates in the plane w.r.t. the shape S. The origin
of an invariant coordinate system could be the Euclidean-invariant (in fact even

Bruckstein

Affine-invariant) centroid of the points S, i.e. Os = [J2i=i ^i) 1^- ^^ ^^^ ^^
axes (say the x-axis) of a "shape-adapted invariant" coordinate system, one may
choose the longest or shortest (or closest in length to the "average" length) vector
among {OPi} fori — 1,2,..., TV. This being settled, the y-axis can be defined
as a 90°- rotation counter-clockwise and all one has to do is to specify P in this
adapted and Euclidean-invariant coordinate system with origin at Os and orthogonal axes chosen as described above. Note that many other solutions are possible.
We here assumed that the points oiS are indistinguishable, otherwise the problem
would be even simpler. Note also that ambiguous situations can and do arise. In
case all the points of S form a regular iV-gon, there are TV equal length vectors
{pPi\ z = 1,2,..., AT and we can not specify uniquely an x-axis. But, a moment
of thought will reveal that in this case the location of any point in the plane is
inherently ambiguous up to rotations of 27r/TV.
Contemplating the above-presented simple example one realizes that solving
the problem of invariant point location is heavily based on the invariants of the
continuous group of transformations V^. The centroid of the point constellation
(5), Os, an invariant under V^^, enabled the description of P using a distance

d{Osy P)y the length of vector OsP (again a V^-invariant), up to a further parameter that locates P on the circle centered at Os with radius d{OsP), and then the
"variability" or inherent "richness" of the geometry of 5* enabled the reduction of
the remaining ambiguity.
Suppose next that v^e v^ant not only to locate points in vs^ays that are invariant
under V^ but we also want to perform invariant motions. This problem is already
completely addressed in the above presented example, once an "5-shape-adapted"
coordinate system became available. Any motion can be defined with respect to
this coordinate system and hence invariantly reproduced by all viewers of S. In
fact, when we establish an adapted frame of references we implicitly determine
the transformation parameters, (/), and can effectively undo the action of F^.
To complicate the matters further consider the possibility that the shape S will
be partially occluded in some of its views. Can we, in this case, establish the location of P invariantly and perform some invariant motions as before? Clearly, in
the example when .S is a point constellation made of AT indistinguishable points, if
we assume that occlusion can remove arbitrarily some of the points, the situation
may become rather hopeless. However, if the occlusion is restricted to wiping out
only points covered by a disk of radius limited to some Rmax, or alternatively, we
can assume that we shall always see all the points within a certain radius around
an (unknown) center point in the plane, the prospects of being able to solve the
problem, at least in certain lucky instances, are much better. Indeed, returning to
our simple example, assume that we have many indistinguishable landmark points
(forming a "reference" shape S in the plane), and that a mobile robot navigates in
the plane, and has a radius of sensing or visibility of Rmax- At each location of the
robot in the plane, P , it will see all points of 5 whose distance from P is less than
Pmax, Up to an arbitrary rotation. Hence, the question of being able to specify P
from this data becomes the problem of robotic self location w.r.t the landmarks.
So given a reference map (showing the "landmark"points ofS in some "absolute"
coordinate system), we want the robot to be able to determine its location on this
map from what it sees (i.e. a portion of the points of 5 translated by P and seen in
an arbitrary rotated coordinate system). Clearly, to locate itself the robot can do
the following:
Using the arbitrarily rotated constellation of points of S within its
radius of sensing, i.e.

5(P, R) = {QeiPi - P)/Pi e 5, d{{PiP) < R}
when Qe is a rotation matrix 2 x 2 about P, "search" in S for a
similar constellation by checking various center points (2 parameters: Xp^yp) and rotations (1 parameter: 0). As stated this solution
involves a horrendous 3-dimensional search and it must be avoided
by using various available tricks like invariant geometric signatures
and (geometric) hashing based on "distances" from P to n^(Pi — P)

182

Bruckstein
and distances and angles between the Pi's seen from P. This leads
to much more efficient, Hough-Transform like solutions, for the self
location problem. By the way, this is exactly how satelites determine
their orientation in space with respect to the constellations of distant
stars acting as landmark points!

In the above discussed problem it would help if the points of S would be ordered
on a curve, forming, say, a polygonal boundary of a planar region, or would be discrete landmarks on a continuous but clearly visible and definable boundary curve
in the plane. Fortunately for those addressing planar shape analysis problems this
is most often the case.

11.3

Invariant Boundary Signatures for Recognition
under Partial Occlusions

If the shape 5 is a region of R^ with a boundary curve dS = C that is either
smooth or polygonal, we shall have to address the problem of recognizing the
shape S from V^-distorted portions of its boundary. Portions of the boundary,
and not the entire boundary because, we must remember, we are dealing with a
scenario of possible occlusions. Our claim is that if we can effectively solve the
problem of locating a point P on the curve C in a F^-invariant way based on the
"local behavior" of C in a neighborhood of P, then we also have a way to detect
the possible presence of the shape S from a portion of its boundary. How can we
locate P based on the local behavior of C in V^-invariant ways? We shall have
to associate to P a set of numbers ("co-ordinates" or "signature" values) that are
invariant under the class of F^-transformations. To do so, one again has to rely on
known geometric invariants of the group of viewing transformation assumed to
act on S to produce its image. The fact that we live on a curve C makes our life
quite a bit easier.
As an example, consider first the case where C is a polygonal curve
and V(f) is the group of Affine-transformations. Since all the viewing transformations map Hnes into lines and hence the vertices of
the poly-line C into vertices of a transformed poly-line V0((7) we
can define the local neighborhood of each vertex C{i) of C, as
the "ordered" constellation of 2n + 1 points {C(^ - n ) , . . . , C{i 1), C(i), C{i + 1 ) , . . . , C{i -h n)} and associate to C{i) invariants of
V(f, based on this constellation of points. Affine transformations are
known to scale areas by the determinant of their associated 2 x 2 matrix, A, of "shear and scale" parameters, hence we know that ratios of
corresponding areas will be affine invariant. Therefore we could consider the areas of the triangles Ai = [{C{i - l)C{i)C{i -f-1)], A2 =
[C{i - 2)C{i)C{i + 2)] • • • An = [C{i - n), C(i), C{i + n)] and
associate to C(i) a vector of ratios of the type {Ak/Ai\kJ

{ 1 , 2 , . . . , n } , A: ^ I) (See Figure 11.2). This vector will be invariant
under the affine group of viewing transformation and will (hopefully)
uniquely characterize the point (7(i) in an affine-invariant way.

Figure 11.2.
The ideas outlined above provide us a procedure for invariantly characterizing the
vertices of a poly-line, however, we can use similar ideas to also locate intermediate points situated on the line segments connecting them. Note that the number
n in the example above is a locality-parameter : smaller n's imply more local
characterization in terms of the size of neighborhoods on the curve C. Contemplating the foregoing example we may ask how to adapt this method to smooth
curves where there are no vertices to enable us to count "landmark" points to
the left and to the right of the chosen vertex in view-invariant ways. There is a
beautiful body of mathematical work on invariant differential geometry providing differential invariants associated to smooth curves and surfaces, work that
essentially carried out Klein's famous Erlangen program for differential geometry, and is reported on in books and papers that appeared many years ago, see
([97], [890], [378], [501] and [136]). Differential invariants enable us to determine a V^-invariant metric, i.e. a way to measure "length" on the curve C
invariantly with respect to the viewing distortion, similar to the way one has, in

184

Bruckstein

a straightforward manner, the Euclidean-invariant arclength on smooth curves. If
we have an invariant metric, we claim that our problem of invariant point characterizations on C can be readily put in the same framework as in the example
of a poly-line. Indeed we can now use the invariant metric to locate to the left
and right of P on C (if we define P — C(0), and describe C as C()u) where
^ is the invariant metric parameterization of C about C(0) = P) the points
{C(0 - n A ) , . . . , C(0 - A), C(0 + A ) , . . . , C(0 + n A } , and these 2n + 1 points
now form an invariant constellation of landmarks anchored at P == C(0) (See
Figure 11.3). Here A is arbitrarily chosen as a small "invariant" distance in terms
of the invariant metric. It is very nice to see that letting A \ 0 one often recovers, from global invariant quantities that were defined on the constellation of
points about C(0) — P , differential invariant quantities that correspond to known
"generalized invariant curvatures" (generalizing the classical curvature obtained
if Vfj) is the simplest, Euclidean viewing distortion). Therefore to invariantly locate a point P on C, we can use the existing V^ invariant metrics on C (note that
if C is a polygon - the ordering of vertices is an immediate invariant metric!) to
determine about P an invariant constellation of "landmark" points on the boundary curve and use global invariants of V^ to associate to P an "invariant signature
vector" / p ( A ) . If A \ 0 this vector yields, for quite a variety of "good" choices
of invariant quantities "generalized invariant curvatures" for the various viewing
groups of transformations V^.
We however do not propose to let A \ 0. A is a locality parameter (as was n
before) and we could use several small, but finite, values for A to produce (what
we can call) a "scale-space" of invariant signature vectors {/pJAie/^an^eCo/A's)This freedom allows us to associate to a curve C(ju), parameterized in terms
of its "invariant metric or arclength", a vector valued scale space of signature
functions {Ip[iJi)}/n^^eRange^ that will characterize it in both a localized and viewinvariant ways. This characterization being local (its locality being in fact under
our control via A and n) is useful to recognize portions of boundaries in scenes
where planar shapes appear both distorted and partially occluded. The recognition process becomes, in terms of the vector-valued signature function, a partial
matching algorithm, see [129].

11.4

Invariant Processing of Planar Shapes

Smoothing and other processes of modifying and enhancing planar shapes involves moving their points to new locations. Here we are naturally led to define
planar shape deformations or evolutions, by motions of points on the shape boundaries that are small and based on the local geometry, i.e. the geometry of the
constellation of other boundary points in the neighborhood. In the spirit of the
discussion above, we want to do this in "viewing-distortion-invariant" ways. To
do so we have to locate the points of a shape S (or of its boundary C = 6S) and
then invariantly move them to new locations in the plane. The discussions of the

Invariant Processing and Occlusion Resistant Recognition of Planar Shapes

Figure 11.3.
previous sections shov^ed us various v^ays to invariantly locate points on S or in
the plane of S, Moving points around is not much more difficult. We shall have
to associate to each point (of S, or in the plane of S) a vector M whose direction
and length have been defined so as to take us to another point, in a way that is V^invariant. In the example of S being a constellation of points, with a robot using
the points of 5 to locate itself at P, we may also want it to determine a new place
to go, i.e. to determine a point Pnew = P-^M, so as to have the property that from
V<f,{P) a robot using the points { V ^ ( P i ) . . . V(J>{PN)} will be able to both locate
itself and move to V^(Pnew)- Of course, on shapes we shall have to do motions
that achieve certain goals Hke smoothing the shape or enhancing it in desirable
ways as discussed in [761] . To design view-distortion invariant motions, we can
(and indeed must) rely on invariant point characterizations. Suppose we are at a
point P on the boundary C = SS of a, shape S, and we have established a constellation of landmark points about P. We can use the invariant point constellation
about P to define a F^-invariant motion from P to Pnew (See Figure 11.4).
Let us first consider again a very simple example: if V^ is the Affine
group of viewing transformations, the centroid of the point constellations about P is an invariantly defined candidate for Pnew Indeed it
is an average of points around P and the process of moving P to such
^ Pnew

or, differentially, toward such a new position can (relatively

easily) be proved to provide an affine invariant shape smoothing operation. If AS is a polygonal shape, i.e. dS = C is a poly-line, then
moving the vertices according to such a smoothing operation can be
shown to shrink any shape into a polygonal ellipse, "the affine image
of a regular polygon" with the same number of vertices as the original shape. This beautiful result is a generalization of the very early
work of Darboux [244], see also [130] and [717], on "a problem in elementary geometry" that addresses the evolutions of planar polygons
under an iterative process which replaces the vertices of a polygon by
the (ordered) midpoints of its edges. In fact ellipses and polygonal ellipses are the results of many reasonably defined invariant averaging
processes [703].

If we are dealing with a smooth continuous boundary curve C and we move
the points infinitesimally according to a local "velocity" vector invariantly defined we are in the realm of "geometric" curve evolution processes described by
nonlinear partial differential equations. A very prominent recent example of such
an evolution process is the Euclidean invariant curve evolution moving the smooth
boundary points in the direction of the local normal vector Nc proportionally to
the local Euclidean curvature kc. The temporal evolution of simple closed curves
(boundaries of planar shapes) under this rule, described by
— Q == kc^Nc^

boundary.

was thoroughly analyzed and it was proved to smoothly deform and shrink any
original curve into an infinitesimal circle, see e.g. [334] and [361]. This nice
mathematical result, together with the fact that other Euclidean invariant motions
like Blum's prairie fire evolution model [100], [142] which postulates constant
velocity motion in the direction of the local normal and leads to "shocks" or
"wavefront" collisions that were found usefiil for shape descriptions since they
produce the so-called "shape skeletons", generated a lot of interest and activity in
the computer vision community. This activity culminated with the realization that
a variety of geometric and viewpoint invariant shape evolutions exist and may be
useful in invariant shape analysis and classification. Note that kcNc = ^ ^ , i.e.
that in the Euchdean case the invariant vector kcNc associated to a point C on a
smooth curve is the second derivative of the curve with respect to the Euclidean
invariant arclength. This observation yields a very nice interpretation of this invariant evolution: a point on the curve is simply replaced by weighted average of
points of the curve of C{s) in the neighborhood with averaging weight dependent on their distance measured in the view invariant metric, from the anchor part
C. If the averaging kernel is Gaussian then if is readily seen that a "geometric"
diffusion process results, but recall that a variety of local processing and averaging operations are readily available and implementable and should be considered
as viable alternatives in generating useful shape evolutions. The process of de-

riving the invariant evolutions is, of course, readily generalized to more complex
viewing transformations and distortions [131], [703].

11.5 Concluding Remarks
The main point of this paper is the thesis that in doing "practical" view-point
invariant shape recognition or shape processing for smoothing or enhancement,
one has to rely on the interplay between global and local (and preferably not
differential) invariants of the group of viewing transformations.
Invariant reparameterization of curves based on "adapted metrics" enables us
to design generalized and local but not necessarily differential signatures for partially occluded recognition. These signatures have many incarnations, they can
be scalars, vectors or even a scale-space of values associated to each point on
shape boundaries. They are sometimes quite easy to derive, and generalize the
differential concept of "invariant curvature" in meaningful ways. A study of the
interplay between local and global invariances of viewing transformations is also
very useful for invariant shape smoothing, generating invariant scale-space shape
representations, and also leads to various useful invariant shape enhancement an
exaggeration operations.
The point of view that geometry is the study of invariances under groups
of transformations is, of course, the famous Erlangen program of Felix Klein.
Several books appeared over the years that carry out parts of this program for
Euclidean aflfine and projective geometry, see for example Guggenheimer [370],
Buchin [136], Blaschke [97], Lane [501]. These theories found their way into
the computer vision literature rather late, for example though the works of Weiss
[875],[875] [876], [877], [677], Cygansky [242], [833], Abter and Burkhardt [1]
and others. The point of view exposed in this paper developed through a series of
papers written over many years. These papers, with the details of what is exposed
herein, are [127], [126], [128], [130], [131], [129], [132], [761]. Other researchers
have made significant contributions to the field and I'll mention the important contributions of Peter Olver [141], [610], Jean-Michel Morel and T. Cohignac [211],
[212], Luc Van Gool and his team [829], [830], M. Brill [55], [54], Z. Pizlo and
A. Rosenfeld [650], L. Moisan [582], J. Sato and R. Cippola [707], [708] and O.
Faugeras [307].
Students, collaborators and academic colleagues and friends have helped me
develop the point of view exposed in this paper. I am grateful to all of them for
the many hours of discussions and debates on these topics, for agreeing and disagreeing with me, for sometimes fighting and competing, and often joining me on
my personal journey into the field of applied invariance theory.
