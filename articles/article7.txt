Abstract: Phase measuring deflectometry (PMD) is an important technique for the form
measurement of specular surfaces. However, the existing stereo-PMD techniques have noticeable
weaknesses for structured specular surfaces measurement due to the optical axis of the imaging
system must have a notable intersection angle with the optical axis of the display system according
to the law of reflection. This leads to the imaging sensor and the fringe display screen must
be located on the opposite sides of the normal of the surface under test (SUT), which results
in large system volume and measurement shadows when measuring discontinuous specular
surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel near optical coaxial PMD (NCPMD) by utilizing a
plate beamsplitter. With the assistance of plate beamsplitter, the optical axis of display screen
can be configured much closer to the optical axis of the imaging system which makes the system
more compact and has significantly reduced volume compared with the conventional PMD
configuration. Moreover, imaging sensors in the proposed configuration can perpendicularly
capture the SUT, which can drastically decrease measurement shadows caused by discontinuous
structures on the SUT and increases measurement efficiency. A comparison between the proposed
NCPMD and the conventional PDM is studied by measuring a specular step to show the advantage
of the proposed configuration in reducing measurement error caused by structure shadows. A
portable NCPMD prototype with stereo imaging sensors is developed and verified through
experiments. Experimental results show the portable prototype has comparable measurement
accuracy with the existing PMD techniques while has obviously advanced performances for
portable and embedded form measurement, such as small system volume, and light weight.

Introduction

Freeform specular surfaces designed to possess three-dimensional (3D) structured shapes
(i.e., continuous non-differentiable specular surfaces and discontinuous specular surfaces) are
extensively applied in various industrial arenas with the purposes of function integration, and
performance enhancement [1,2]. Fast, accurate, and on-line metrology is an important element
supporting next-generation manufacturing techniques, which requires that measurement systems
must have small volume and light weight, so that it can be embedded into manufacturing
systems to give timely feedback of measurement information [3,4]. However, portable, and
embedded 3D form measurement of structured specular surfaces is still a challenge for current
form measurement techniques, such as fringe projection profilometry, interferometry, stylus
profilometer, and Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). Fringe projection profilometry [5,6]
cannot be applied in specular surfaces measurement due to the inadequacy of measurement
principle. Interferometry [7,8] is difficult and complicated to be applied in the in-site form
measurement due to its sensitive to the environmental disturbance and the limited space of the
station of work. Stylus profilometer [9,10] and CMM [11] are common tools for the measurement

of surface form in industry. However, the stylus profilometer and CMM are heavy and large, and
the stylus probe can damage the surface under test (SUT). Phase measuring deflectometry (PMD)
is a well-known 3D form measurement technique for freeform specular surfaces [12–14]. A
camera and an LCD (liquid crystal display) screen are basic elements of current PMD systems.
3D data of a SUT can be obtained based on phase calculation and geometrical optical relationship
of the camera, the SUT, and the screen [15,16]. PMD systems can be classified into three
categories according to system configuration and the number of the applied cameras and screens:
single screen and sensor based PMD [17,18], multi-screen based PMD [19,20], and multi-sensor
based PMD [21,22]. Single screen and sensor based PMD only uses a camera and a screen.
Generally, PMD techniques based on this configuration can only obtain gradient information
of the SUT and cannot calculate absolute 3D form data. With the help of laser pointers, Burke
et al. studied a PMD technique with this configuration which can obtain absolute shape of
SUT [23]. However, it is difficult to measure discontinuous specular surfaces using PMDs
with this configuration. Multi-screen based PMD measures freeform specular surfaces using
multiple screens. Direct phase measuring deflectometry (DPMD) [24,25] is a PMD technique
with two screens, which has the capability to measure structured specular surfaces. However, the
applied two screens lead to larger system volume than PMD systems with single screen, which
results in difficulty in embedded measurement. Several PMD techniques with coaxial optical
configuration have been studied. Huang et al. proposed a co-axial software configurable optical
test system (SCOTS) technique for measuring large aspherical mirror [26]. SCOTS is designed
for large mirror measurement and has a long working distance, therefore this technique is not
suitable for embedded measurement. Moreover, SCOTS cannot measure discontinuous/structured
surfaces because it is a slope measurement technique. Tang et al. presented a co-axial PMD
technique based on a beam splitter for measuring aspheric mirror [19]. This technique requires
both the camera and the screen have a movement along the tested mirror optical axis in the
measurement process, which costs much time and needs large measurement space. Therefore,
this technique shows disadvantages in the application of online and embedded measurement.
Guo et al. proposed an improved PMD technique for measuring aspheric surfaces [27]. This
technique requires a camera aperture to be placed near the center of curvature of the test mirror
and centers of all components must be coaxial. This technique will need a long working distance
when measuring specular surfaces with large curvature radius, so it is not suitable for embedded
measurement in these cases. In addition, this technique is also weak in the measurement of
discontinuous/structured surfaces because it is a slope measurement technique. Häusler et al.
presented a coaxial PMD with the name of Microdeflectometry [28]. Microdeflectometry is
developed for the measurement in microscopic field and is difficult to be applied to measure
large scale discontinuous specular surfaces. Stereo-PMD applies a screen and multiple cameras
to measure freeform specular surfaces by using stereo vision algorithm, which has no strict
requirements on the relative position of the optical elements (cameras and screen) because these
parameters can be calculated through system calibration. Whether a co-axial optical path is used
or not has little effect on the measurement accuracy of stereo-PMD when measuring continuous
freeform specular surfaces. Therefore, stereo-PMD systems do not need to consider a co-axial
configuration in traditional applications. Segmentation phase measuring deflectometry (SPMD)
[29,30] is a stereo-PMD technique with two cameras, which shows great advantages in the
measurement capability for structured specular surfaces and remarkable measurement accuracy.
Current SPMD systems [29,30] have similar configuration with other existing stereo-PMD
techniques. The cameras and the screen in the conventional configuration must locate on opposite
sides of the normal of the SUT and the size of the display screen must be significantly larger
than the SUT according to the law of reflection. This leads to a non-compact distribution of
the cameras and the screen and large system volume. Although the cameras and the screen
can be placed close together when a PMD system is far away from the SUT (like the case of

measuring low-gradient mirror using SCOTS [31,32]), it cannot be realized in most of the in-situ
measurement situations as size of SUT is small and the gradient of the SUT is large and the
measurement space is limited compare with the application of SCOTS system. In addition, the
optical axis of the imaging system must have a notable intersection angle with the optical axis of
the display system in the conventional configuration, measurement shadows are inevitable when
steps exist between the segmented structures on the SUT, which leads the data loss and erroneous
of surface points.
In this paper, we present a novel near optical coaxial PMD (NCPMD) by utilizing a plate
beamsplitter. Imaging sensors and screen in the proposed configuration can have a compact
distribution with the function of the beamsplitter, which significantly reduces the system volume
compared with the conventional configuration. In addition, the imaging sensors in the proposed
configuration can capture the SUT close to perpendicular to the SUT, which can significantly
reduce shadows of the steps and erroneous measurement points. The paper is organized as
following. The principle and methods of the proposed configuration is presented in Section
2. Section 3 verifies the effectiveness of the proposed configuration through experiments. The
conclusion is presented in Section 4.

Principle and methods

2.1. Comparison between conventional PMD configuration and the proposed NCPDM
A fringe-displaying screen and a camera are essential optical elements of a PMD system. The
camera is required to capture the fringe patterns displayed on the screen through the reflection of
the SUT and then calculates phase data of the captured fringe patterns. Therefore, a common
constraint of the configuration of a PMD system is that the screen must cover all reflected camera
rays after the reflection of the SUT. In addition, another constraint of the configuration is that the
angle between the camera ray and the normal of the SUT should be designed as small as possible
to ensure that the camera can capture more surface points for better lateral resolution. Moreover,
embedded measurement brings additional constraint to the configuration which requires the
applied PMD should have a short working distance so that the measurement system could be as
close to the SUT as possible in the narrow space of manufacturing systems. Figure 1(a) shows
the configuration of conventional stereo-PMD systems considering the configuration constraints
in the case of embedded measurement. In this configuration, the cameras and the screen have
a dispersed distribution on opposite sides of the normal of the SUT to meet all configuration
constraints. Obviously, this configuration is not compact and results in large system volume,
which has significant drawbacks when performing embedded measurement. Figure 1(b) illustrates
shadow problem of the conventional stereo-PMD configuration when measuring specular surfaces
with discontinuous structures. Since both the light from the screen and the cameras have an
obvious tilt to the surface normal of the SUT in the configuration, the depth difference between
the structures on the SUT will cause obvious shadows. The range of the shadows increases with
the raise of the depth difference between the structures and the angle between the cameras, the
SUT, and the screen. The structure shadows result in massive data loss of surface points.
In order to solve the problems of the conventional stereo-PMD configuration in embedded
measurement of structured specular surfaces, we investigate a novel near optical coaxial PMD
technique by utilizing a plate beamsplitter into PMD systems, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The
plate beamsplitter is located at an angle of approximately 45 degrees in front of the SUT. The
screen, the plate beamsplitter, and the SUT approximately form an equilateral triangle. The
cameras in NCPMD can capture the SUT approximately perpendicularly through the beamsplitter.
The image of the screen after the reflection of the plate beamsplitter forms an equivalent
screen which is approximately parallel to the SUT, as the equivalent configuration shown in
Fig. 2(b). It is the equivalent screen performing the role of displaying fringe patterns during the
measurement process in NCPMD. Note that there is no strict requirement for the angle between

the beamsplitter and the screen, and the angle between the beamsplitter and the SUT, because
the relative relationship between the cameras and the equivalent screen can be obtained through
system calibration. NCPMD has two significant advantages compared with the conventional
PMD configuration. One is the configuration of NCPMD is more compact. A qualitative
comparison of hardware setups between the conventional stereo-PMD configuration and NCPMD
is demonstrated in Fig. 3(a). It is obvious that system volume of the NCPMD setup is considerably
reduced compared with conventional stereo-PMD setup. The size of the SUT has little effect on
the reduction of the system because the proposed configuration reduces the volume of the system
by increasing the compactness of the measurement system. Another advantage of NCPMD is
that measurement shadows caused by surface structures can be decreased dramatically since the
optical axis of display screen in NCPMD can be configured much close to the optical axis of
the imaging system and the light from both the imaging system and the screen in NCPMD can
be nearly perpendicular to the SUT, as the illustration of Fig. 2(c). Figure 3(b) is a picture of
the captured fringe image of a discontinuous structured specular surface by the conventional
configuration. Serious shadows can be observed in this picture because both screen light and
camera ray illuminate obliquely on the SUT. By contrast, a captured picture of the same structured
specular surface by NCPMD is shown in Fig. 3(c), where shadow area is greatly reduced.

2.2.

System calibration of NCPMD

PMD is an optical measurement technique based on the principle of geometrical optics. The relationship between the screen and cameras in NCPMD must be calibrated before the measurement.
The NCPMD system contains several optical components such as the cameras and the screen.
Each optical display/imaging component has its own coordinate system which is related to the
physical spatial position of the component, as shown in Fig. 4. We need to turn these independent coordinate systems into a common coordinate system through calibration for subsequent
measurement and operation. In this paper, all coordinate systems are established relation with
the imaging coordinate system of camera 1. Therefore, all data information in the measurement
system can be converted to this common coordinate system for measurement calculation. Since
the equivalent screen in NCPMD performs the function of displaying fringe patterns, we just
need to calculate the position relationship between the cameras and the equivalent screen for the
calibration of the NCPMD once the relative position of the true screen, the beamsplitter, and
the cameras remains unchanged in the subsequent measurement process. The NCPMD system
contains an LCD screen, a beamsplitter, and two cameras. Using {L ′ }, {C1 }, {C2 }, {P1 }, {P2 } to
represent the coordinate system of the equivalent screen (LCD’ in Fig. 4), the camera coordinate
system of Camera 1, the camera coordinate system of Camera 2, the pixel coordinate system

In order to further improve the calibration accuracy, distortion compensation method must be
applied to eliminate the error between the real imaging process and the applied ideal imaging
model. In our paper, we used an iterative distortion elimination method [33] instead of the
traditional polynomial-based method [34]. By using the calibration result of Eq. (6) as initial
value, the deviation caused by distortion between real camera pixel and the reprojection camera
pixel calculated based on the linear projection can be obtained. A corrected coordinate for the
camera pixel can be obtained by compensating the deviation. By using the Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm, the calibration parameters can be iteratively optimized by minimizing the difference
between the corrected coordinate and the reprojection pixel.

Experiments and results

3.1. Comparison of measurement results between conventional PMD configuration
and NCPMD
A comparison is conducted to show the measurement difference between the convention PMD
configuration and NCPMD. Two setups are developed based on the convention configuration
and NCPMD. Two cameras used in the experiments are Lw235M from Lumenera. The screen

Research Article

applied in the setups is iPad Mini from Apple. The beamsplitter used in the comparison is 1.1
mm thick and has a size of 150 mm × 120 mm in length and width. Reflectivity and transmittance
of the beamsplitter are 50% and 50%. There is little influence on the measurement accuracy if
the beam splitter is misoriented, because the relative position relationship of optical elements in
the system is calculated through calibration. A circular specular gauge with three circular step
structures is measured by the two setups. We averaged every five obtained fringe images for
reducing phase noise and using eight-step phase-shifting algorithm to calculate wrapped phase
map. Absolute phase map is obtained by using optimized 3-frequency selection method [35].
Figure 5 shows the difference of phase calculation results of the measured circular specular gauge
between the two setups. Figure 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) shows the phase values of the circular specular
gauge obtained by camera 1 and camera 2 in the setup developed based on the conventional
configuration. The damage of a large amount of phase data caused by structure shadows can
be observed in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b). By contrast, the phase values of the circular specular
gauge obtained by camera 1 and camera 2 in the setup developed based on NCPMD are shown
in Fig. 5(c) and Fig. 5(d). The amount of damaged phase data in Fig. 5(c) and Fig. 5(d) is
significantly reduced compared with Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b). Based on the measurement method
of stereo-PMD, both 3D coordinates and gradient data of the SUT can be obtained [29,30].
We separate a structured surface into continuous segments and reconstruct each segment with
gradient data to achieve good form accuracy, and finally fuse all reconstructed segments into a
wohle 3D strucutred form result based on their absolute 3D coordinate data. Figure 6 compares
the measurement results between the conventional configuration and NCPMD. Figure 6(a) shows
3D form of the circular specular mirror reconstructed by the setup developed based on the
conventional configuration. Figure 6(b) shows the reconstruction result of the circular specular
mirror obtained by the setup developed based on NCPMD. It is obvious that NCPMD has an
advanced measurement efficiency by decreasing invalid data area caused by structure shadows
compared with the conventional configuration. Table 1 compares the measurement accuracy of
the structure heights on the measured circular specular gauge obtained by on the convention
configuration and NCPMD. Measurement result of CMM is used as a benchmark to evaluate
the measurement accuracy of the two configurations. The step heights of the first structure, the
second structure, and the third structure obtained by CMM are 5617 µm, 3676 µm, and 4672 µm,
respectively. The step heights of the first structure, the second structure, and the third structure
measured by the setup developed based on the conventional configuration are 5626 µm, 3682 µm,
and 4661 µm, respectively. The step heights of the first structure, the second structure, and the
third structure measured by the setup developed based on NCPMD are 5580 µm, 3710 µm, and
4610 µm, respectively. Both the measurement difference between CMM and stereo-PMD with
the conventional configuration, and the measurement difference between CMM and NCPMD,
are all around tens of microns. The standard deviation of the measurement result of NCPMD is
15.4 µm. The comparison result shows that NCPMD has slightly lower measurement accuracy
compared with the conventional stereo-PMD configuration [29,30] but has significant advantage
in reducing measurement shadows for measuring structured specular surfaces.
3.2.

Experimental verification of a portable NCPMD prototype

A portable NCPMD prototype is developed based on the proposed configuration for embedded 3D
form measurement of structured specular surfaces, as shown in Fig. 7. The prototype contains a
7-inch LCD screen (Feelworld FW279), two CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor)
cameras (XIMEA xiC), and a plate beamsplitter. The screen, the cameras, and the beamsplitter
are fixed on an aluminum framework. The current volume of the prototype is 230 mm in length,
200 mm in width, and 160 mm in height. Considering the profile of the aluminum framework is
20 mm thick, the volume of the prototype can be further decreased to 190 mm in length, 160
mm in width, and 120 mm in height. Total weight of the prototype including the aluminum

framework is 2.6 kg. The volume and the weight of the prototype facilitate the prototype to be
fixed on robotic arm for on-line measurement or to be embedded into manufacturing systems.
The prototype is calibrated with the method described in Section 2.2. We use the reprojection
error to represent the calibration result as shown in Fig. 8(a) where reprojection error is within
1 pixel. The colors in Fig. 8(a) are used to distinguish the obtained reprojection error when
the flat mirror is placed at different calibration positions during the calibration process. A
rectangular step mirror is measured to verify the absolute measurement accuracy of the prototype.
The reconstruction result of the measured rectangular step mirror is shown in Fig. 8(b). The
reconstruction result is compared with the measurement result of CMM and the traditional
stereo-PMD, as shown in Table 2. The distance from step 1 to step 2, the distance from step 1
to step 3, and the distance from step 1 to step 4 are 4877 µm, 8854 µm, and 11951 µm in the
measurement result of the prototype, respectively. By contrast, those values are 4942 µm, 8868
µm, and 11863 µm in the measurement result of CMM, and are 4924 µm, 8841 µm, and 11853
µm in the measurement result of the traditional stereo-PMD. The measurement difference of the
rectangular step mirror between the prototype and CMM is around tens of microns, which shows
the absolute measurement accuracy of the prototype is similar with the previous stereo-PMD
system developed based on the conventional configuration [29,30]. The standard deviation of
the measurement result of the prototype is 37.9 µm. We also measured a concave specular
gauge to verify the measurement accuracy of the prototype for measuring continuous specular
surfaces. Figure 8(c) shows reconstruction result of the concave specular gauge obtained by the
prototype. As the measured concave specular gauge is a spherical concave, the measurement
error is determined by comparing the difference between the measurement result of the prototype
and the surface parameters of the concave specular gauge provided by the manufacturer, as shown
in Fig. 8(d). Peak value and root mean square of measurement difference are 162 nm and 24 nm,
which is at the same level as the measurement accuracy of the previous gradient-based PMD
techniques with the conventional configuration [36,37]. Though comparison results show that
NCPMD has slightly lower measurement accuracy compared with the conventional stereo-PMD
configuration, measurement accuracy of NCPMD is still in the same order of magnitude with
the conventional configuration (tens of microns in absolute measurement accuracy). On the
other hand, NCPMD has significant advantage in reducing measurement shadows for measuring
structured specular surfaces and decreasing system volume, which shows obvious benefits when
doing embedded measurement of structured specular surfaces.

Conclusion

A novel near optical coaxial PMD by utilizing a plate beamsplitter is presented in this paper for
portable and embedded measurement of structured specular surfaces. The presented NCPMD
technique has considerable advantages of compact configuration, light weight, and insignificant
measurement error caused by structure shadows, compared with the exciting PMD techniques
based on the conventional configuration. There are several factors coming from the beamsplitter
that should have influence on the measurement accuracy of the NCPMD system, such as flatness

and the refraction influence of the applied plate beamsplitter. Methods will be investigated to
compensate the negative impact of the beamsplitter in the next step. In addition, new calibration
methods and reconstruction algorithms will be explored to increase the measurement accuracy of
NCPMD. The developed portable prototype will be applied in manufacturing systems and/or
manufacture line to further test the measurement performance of the prototype.
