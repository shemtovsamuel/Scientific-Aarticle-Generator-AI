Abstract
Accurate and fast three-dimensional (3D) measurement for industrial products/components designed to possess 3D structured
shapes is a key driver for improved productivity. However, challenges for current techniques are considerable to measure
structured specular surfaces. A technique named segmentation phase measuring deflectometry (SPMD) is proposed in this
paper, which enables structured specular surfaces to be measured with high accuracy in one setup. Concept of segmentation in topology is introduced into phase measuring deflectometry, which separates a surface with complex structures into
continuous segments. Each segment can be reconstructed based on gradient information to achieve good form accuracy, and
all reconstructed segments can be fused into a whole 3D strucutred form result based on their absolute spatial positioning
data. Here, we propose and discuss the principle of SPMD, a segmentation technique to separate a strucured surface into
segments, a spatial positioning technique to obtain absolute position of the segments, and a data fusion strategy to fuse all
reconstructed segments. Experimental results show SPMD can achieve nanometer level accuracy for form measurement of
continuous segments by comparing with stylus profilometer, which is significantly higher than the accuracy of direct phase
measuring deflectometry. Meanwhile, SPMD has micron level spatial positioning accuracy for structures by measuring two
specular steps and comparing with coordinate measuring machine, which differentiates this technique from gradient-based
phase measuring deflectometry that extends measurement capability from continuous specular surfaces to complex structured specular surfaces. Compared with the existing measurement techniques, SPMD significantly improved the convenience
and ability to measure freeform and structured specular surfaces with the advantages of high measurement accuracy, fast
measurement, and potential application for embedded measurement.

1 Introduction
Driven by the ever-increasing demand for function integration, performance enhancement, and light weight, more
and more next-generation industrial products/components
are designed to possess three-dimensional (3D) structured
shapes (i.e., non-rotational symmetric and discontinuous),
to be made of multi-materials (e.g., materials with different
reflective characteristics) and/or to integrate different shapes/
structures [1, 2]. Accurate, fast, and in-line metrology is a

key element underpinning future autonomous manufacturing systems. However, it is still a challenging assignment
for current metrologies to measure structured specular surface. An example is seen in a monolithic multi-mirror arrays
(shown in Fig. 1) on the Mid-Infrared instrument (MIRI)
Spectrometer Optics for the James Webb Space Telescope
[3]. It comprises 21 individual spherical mirrors of 11-mm
length and 1-mm width. The relative 3D spatial position
error of all the individual mirrors requires < 20 µm. Meanwhile, form accuracy of individual mirror must be better
than 50 nm root mean square (RMS) [4]. The positions of
the centers of each mirror are varied in a space coordinate
system, and the big steps between each of the mirrors make
it difficult for any of the exit measurement instrument to
perform a measurement of the whole part in one setup. Coordinate measuring machine (CMM) [5] and stylus profilometer [6] are measurement techniques that are well accepted

in industry. CMM records detailed dimensional figures by
using a probe moving along workpiece surface; therefore,
it can be used to accurately measure a surface with complex geometric shape. Stylus profilometer uses a stylus tip to
physically touch the measured surface and evaluates the surface error by fitting the collected data and comparing with
ideal surface model. Measurement accuracy of stylus profilometer can be achieved to a few tens of nanometers. However, because both stylus profilometer and CMM are based
on point scanning, these techniques are time-consuming and
have a potential damage for the test surface by the stylus tip.
Moreover, some disadvantages in stylus profilometer and
CMM, such as high cost and large volume, are difficult to be
solved due to requirements of their measurement principles.
Interferometry is a well-known non-contact optical measurement method based on interference principle [7]. Shore
et al. tried to test the multi-mirror arrays by using a Twyman
Green phase shifting interferometer [4]. The interferometer
can successfully obtain the form data of individual mirrors.
However, it has to be mounted on a three-axis machine in
order to measure the spatial positioning of the individual
mirrors, which results in that the measurement procedures
were very complex and the measurement accuracy requirements for the whole part were difficult to achieve.
Phase measuring deflectometry (PMD) is an optical technique developed for 3D measurement of freeform specular
surface with advantages of good accuracy, low cost, and
full-field and non-contact measurement [8–10]. According to approaches of obtaining form information, PMD
can be divided into two categories: gradient-based phase
measuring deflectometry (GPMD) [11–14], and direct
phase measuring deflectometry (DPMD) [15, 16]. GPMD
obtains gradients of the measured surface using phase data
and then reconstructs form data based on gradient integration. In contrast, DPMD directly calculates form information from phase data instead of gradients by establishing the
relationship between phase value and depth change based

13

on mathematical model. GPMD can generally achieve submicron measurement accuracy or even tens of nanometers
accuracy in the case of measuring low curvature surfaces
[17], because of high sensitivity of gradient variation. Zhang
et al. proposed a deflectometry method based on 3D digital
image correlation for measuring the form of specular surface [18]. A liquid crystal display (LCD) screen is required
to be moved during a measurement process; therefore, this
system is not suitable for embedded measurement since
the movement of screen needs large space. GPMD can
only measure continuous surface due to the limitation of
the principle of integral method. By contrast, DPMD can
measure discontinuous specular surface because form data
are extracted from phase value directly. Shi et al. developed
an infrared PMD which combines a binary fringe defocusing technique and DPMD [19]. However, significant phase
noise is introduced to the calculation process of this technique, which results in measurement accuracy of DPMD to
only reach tens of microns [15, 16]. A measurement of the
multi-mirror arrays mentioned above has been studied by
using DPMD [15]. Though rough form data of the whole
part can be obtained successfully, measurement accuracy
of DPMD is far from meeting the requirement of individual
mirror. Wang et al. studied a method to improve measurement accuracy of DPMD by introducing stereo algorithm
[20]; however, DPMD is difficult to be applied in embedded
measurements since two screens used in the system result in
large system volume. We classify stereo deflectometry [21,
22] as a kind of GPMD technique. Note that stereo deflectometry can obtain absolute depth data in the process of
solving gradient information, while other GPMD techniques
can only obtain gradient data. Therefore, in theory, stereo
deflectometry has a capacity of reconstructing a structured
specular surface based on the obtained absolute depth data.
However, because the absolute depth accuracy is not good
(almost in the same order of magnitude as DPMD) compared with the accuracy of the depth reconstructed with
gradients, scholars generally ignore the directly obtained
absolute depth information and focus on using its ability of
gradient measurement to detect continuous specular surfaces
[17, 21, 22]. Overall, challenges for current techniques are
considerable when measuring structured specular surfaces
represented by the multi-mirror arrays, requiring important
innovations in measurement techniques to achieve the ambitious target of accurate, embedded, and in-line measurement.
Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to enhance the
measurement capability of PMD, which we call segmentation phase measuring deflectometry (SPMD). Three novel
techniques are presented in this paper: segmentation technique, spatial positioning technique, and data fusion strategy.
Segmentation, the concept that we first applied in terms of
PMD, working together with our developed spatial positioning technique and data fusion strategy, enables SPMD

The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (2022) 119:2271–2283

to perform a measurement of structured specular surfaces
with high accuracy in one setup. The concept of segmentation in SPMD means separating a surface with complex
structures into several continuous segments. The developed
spatial positioning technique can establish the relative locations of the segments with micron level accuracy. Individual
segment is reconstructed and smoothed based on gradient
data, which enables form accuracy of individual segment
to approach nanometer level accuracy. Data fusion strategy
is studied to connect individual segment with the spatial
location. The concept of this technique promises remarkable advancement of 3D measurement of structured specular
surfaces with its advantages of high accuracy, fast speed, and
full-field measurement.

2 Principle and methods
2.1 Introduction of SPMD
A SPMD system consists of a fringe displaying screen and
two imaging sensors, whose working principle is illustrated
in Fig. 2. The screen, the structured specular surface under
test, and individual imaging sensor form a spatial triangle,
so that imaging sensors can detect the fringes on the screen
through the reflection of the specular surface. Compared
with the fringe displayed on the screen, the fringe captured
by imaging sensors is deformed due to the shape of the
measured surface. Processing the deformed fringes on the
imaging sensors with our developed spatial positioning
method, spatial location and gradients of the surface can be
obtained simultaneously. During a measurement process,
the screen is required to display multiple phase-shifting
sinusoidal fringe patterns in vertical and horizontal

2273

directions. A two-dimensional (2D) phase coordinate system can be created by extracting mutually perpendicular
absolute phase values from the displayed fringe patterns.
Since a well-manufactured LCD screen is generally
accepted as the fringe displaying screen in current PMD
system, it is quite simple to establish the relationship
between the phase coordinate system and a 2D physical
coordinate system on the screen based on the screen pixel
size, so that the physical location on the screen corresponding to a phase coordinate can be calculated accurately.
When the fringe patterns are displayed on the screen, the
imaging sensors synchronously capture each reflected fringe
pattern. Two mutually perpendicular absolute phase maps
carrying the form information of the measured specular
surface can be extracted from the captured fringe patterns
by applying phase shifting and phase unwrapping algorithms. Individual phase map is a 3D matrix, which consists
of pixel coordinates of the imaging sensor as horizontal and
vertical coordinates and phase values as depth coordinate.
Therefore, if knowing a pixel coordinate, the corresponding
coordinate in terms of the phase coordinate system can be
obtained by applying 2D interpolating to horizontal absolute phase map and vertical absolute phase map, using S to
represent an arbitrary space point near the measured surface. Its image point, denoted with P1, in terms of the pixel
coordinate system of an imaging sensor can be easily
obtained after calibrating of the imaging parameters of the
sensor. Phase coordinate of P1 in terms of the phase coordinate system can be obtained by applying the interpolation
method based on the pixel coordinate of P1. Then, the corresponding physical location on the screen, denoted with
Q1, can be calculated based on the relationship between the
phase coordinate system and the physical coordinate system. Assuming S is a point on the measured surface,

incident light Q1 S and outgoing light SP1 should obey the
law of reflection. Consequently, an equivalent normal vector
of S can be calculated
based on Q1, S , and P1, which is

Fig. 2, only when S in on the surface, n1 is equal to n2 , and
both are equal to the real normal vector of the measured
specular surface. Therefore, we can change the spatial coordinate of S , e.g. by changing the coordinate of S along a
camera ray, to obtain⇀ a position
(denoted as S1) where the
⇀
difference between n1 and n(2 reaches minimum.
Here, we

(

use x(1,1) y(1,1) z(1,1) and nx(1,1) ny(1,1) 1 to express the

spatial coordinate and the calculated normal vector of S1,
respectively. Note that though this process is similar to the
gradient obtain process of stereo deflectometry, the difference is that the calculated absolute depth data is commonly
disregarded in stereo deflectometry, while in SPMD, both
spatial positioning data and gradient data are fully utilized
based on the concept of segmentation to participate in the
later data fusion process.
Phase error is inevitably involved in the process of
extracting absolute phase values from the captured fringe
patterns, which is resulted by complex factors such as electronic noise of the screen and imaging sensors, nonlinear
error in fringe display and capture, fringe blur caused by
lens defocus, and calibration error etc., using 𝛿Q to represent
physical location error on the screen caused by the phase
error. With the benefit of our previous study [23], the influence of 𝛿Q on spatial positioning accuracy can be expressed
with Eq. (1), regardless of calibration error in terms of the
relative position between the screen and the imaging sensors:

tan𝛾
𝛿Q
𝛿z =
1 + Ls ∕Ld

(1)

where 𝛿z represents spatial positioning error in depth direction.Ls and Ld represent the length from the measured surface to the screen and to the imaging sensor, respectively. 𝛾
denotes the angle between surface normal and camera ray. In
a SPMD system, 𝛾 is around 45°. Assuming Ld is k times of
Ls ( k is generally changing from 1 to 4 in a SPMD system),
Eq. (1) can be simplified as Eq. (2).

𝛿z =

k
𝛿Q
1+k

(2)

According to Eq. (2), 𝛿z and 𝛿Q are in the same order
of magnitude (which is tens of micrometers in our experiments). Though the result of spatial positioning can present
3D information of the measured surface in terms of micrometer scale, the accuracy requires further improvement for
measuring a surface with nanometer level accuracy requirement. To realize this purpose, gradient data are studied to

13

optimize and smooth the measurement data. Our previous
work [23] shows that the relationship between 𝛿Q and gradient error can be described as Eq. (3).

𝛿𝛼 =

1
𝛿Q
2Ls

(3)

where 𝛿𝛼 is the gradient error caused by 𝛿Q . According to
Eqs. (2) and (3), gradient data is ~ 2Ls k∕(k + 1) times better than spatial positioning data in terms of restraining the
influence of phase error. Ls is typically larger than 100 mm
in a PMD system, which leads to reconstructed surface based
on gradient integration to achieve submicron or even tens of
nanometers form accuracy. However, an obvious defect of
gradient integration technique is that it can only be applied
to a continuous surface. Serious measurement error will be
introduced when reconstructing a structured surface with
gradient data. Here, we use a concept of segmentation to
solve this problem as shown in Fig. 2. The measured structured specular surface is partitioned into multiple continuous
segments with gradient information. Individual continuous
segment can be reconstructed with their gradient data to
achieve nanometer level form accuracy. However, the reconstruction process results in a missing of the absolute depth
information of the reconstructed segment. A data fusion
technique must be conducted to recover the absolute position in space of the reconstructed segment to reconstruct the
3D form of the whole structured specular surface.

2.2 Spatial positioning and segmentation process
in SPMD
Figure 3 demonstrates the process of obtaining absolute 3D
coordinates and gradients information of a structured specular surface in SPMD. Calibration is an important and first
step of the process, which is to obtain the transformation
matrix HL between screen coordinate system {L} and phase
coordinate system, the relationship between {L} and camera
coordinate systems ({C1 } and {C2 }), transformation{matrix

which records the gradient information of the measured surface. Note that even for a true reflection point, d(i,j) cannot
equal zero due to calibration and phase noise error. However,

d(i,j) of a true reflection point (point on the surface of the
measured structured specular mirror) is still much small compared with those obtained by points beyond the sample under
test (SUT) and points on the edge of segments. Therefore, a
threshold can be used to remove non-surface points and edge
points in spatial coordinates matrix and normal vector matrix
by evaluating the size of d(i,j). In our experiments, the threshold is commonly at micron level for a well-calibrated system.
The monolithic multi-mirror arrays on the MIRI Spectrometer Optics shown in Fig. 1 are used as measurement sample
to demonstrate the segmentation process. Figure 4a and b
show the obtained matrixes of normal vector along x and y
direction, where non-surface points and edge points have
been removed based on the threshold method. Figure 4c
shows a two direction (2D) projection in z direction of a normal vector matrix expressed in terms of pixel coordinate
system. Each continuous segment of the normal vector matrix
can be clearly distinguished after the removement with the
threshold method, as shown in Fig. 4c. In order to achieve the
segmentation, a region of interest (ROI) covering a whole
target segment is selected, as shown in Fig. 4c. The data outside the target segment may be covered by the ROI especially
when a target segment has complex shape. In order to eliminate the data outside target segment (DOTS) in ROI, a region

of DOTS, which is used as a region mask to accurately
extract the target segment. All continuous segments of the
measured sample can be extracted by repeating segmentation
process. A flowchart is used to summarize the segmentation
process of SPMD, as shown in Fig. 5.

form accuracy of the target segment compared with the
rough 3D position data, as shown in Fig. 6. On the other
hand, the reconstructed depth data is a relative value; therefore, a method is required to be studied to recapture the absolute spatial position of the reconstructed target segment to
obtain the spatial location relationship between segments,

2.3 Data fusion
Figure 6 is used to illustrate the data fusion strategy of
SPMD by measuring the monolithic multi-mirror arrays.
Two imaging sensors capture the deformed fringe patterns
along x and y directions through the reflection of the measured mirror. By processing the captured patterns with the
developed spatial positioning technique, rough space point
cloud with spatial positioning information and gradient data
along x, y direction of the mirror can be obtained. Then, a
target continuous segment is separated from the structured
mirror by extracting the corresponding region mask in terms
of pixel coordinates based on the proposed segmentation
method. Data in depth direction of the target segment can
be reconstructed based on the gradient data and x, y coordinates. On one hand, the reconstructed depth data improves

all continuous segments can be reconstructed with gradient
data, and recaptured absolute depth data based on the fusion
technique. So far, improvement of measurement accuracy of
the structured mirrors has completed. Final step is to establish the relationship between the 21 reconstructed structured
mirrors and the base of the mirror to complete the reconstruction of the whole structured surface. This step can be
achieved through a fusion process by using the reconstructed
mirrors to replace the corresponding rough 3D position data.
A comparison between final fusion result and rough position
data shown in Fig. 6 can reflect the improvement of surface
accuracy after the fusion process.

3 Experiments and results
We measured three structured specular mirrors to evaluate the measurement accuracy of SPMD in terms of spatial
positioning accuracy and form measurement accuracy to an
individual continuous segment, respectively. The SPMD system and the sample under test (SUT) are shown in Fig. 7a.
A tablet (iPad Pro 12.9-inch, Apple) is used as the fringedisplaying screen of the SPMD system in experiments. Two
CCD (Charge-coupled Device) cameras (Lw235M, Lumenera)
are used as the imaging sensors in the system. Resolution of

the cameras is 1616 × 1216 pixels. 35 mm fixed focal length
lens (MVL35M23, Navitar) is mounted on the cameras. The
cameras focus on the SUT during the measurement process.
Fringe patterns are generated by programming with Matlab. Two groups of perpendicular sinusoidal fringe patterns
with fringe numbers of 225, 224, and 210 are generated in
our experiments according to requirements of phase calculation algorithms. Duet Display is used to turn the tablet into a
second monitor to sequentially display the generated fringe
patterns with high performance. A sinusoidal fringe period
of the fringe pattern with fringe number of 225 takes up 10
screen pixels. The displayed fringe patterns are captured by the
cameras through the reflection of the SUT. In order to reduce
phase noise, we averaged of every 5 obtained fringe images.
Then, eight-step phase-shifting algorithm is used to calculate
wrapped phase map with the averaged fringe images. Absolute
phase map can be obtained by unwrapping the wrapped phase
map with optimized 3-frequency selection method [24, 25].
The SPMD system in experiments is calibrated based on holistic calibration method [22]. During the calibration process,
a high-precision plane mirror moves arbitrarily several times
around the position of the object to be measured. The screen
in SPMD is reflected by the plane mirror and captured by the
imaging sensors. Therefore, the imaged screen can be used as a
phase target to calibrate the imaging parameter of the imaging
sensors [26, 27]. Then, the transformation relationship between

13

each imaged screen and an imaging sensor can be used to calculate the spatial relationship between the real screen and an
imaging sensor in SPMD. Finally, an iterative optimization is
applied to optimize the calibration parameters in SPMD. Leastsquares method [28] is applied to reconstruct form data of a
continuous segment with gradient data. The principle of the

reconstruction method is based on an approximation that the
normal vector of a point is perpendicular to the vectors connecting points at either side. Radial basis function integration
(RBFI) method [29] is used as a supplementary constraint of
the reconstruction method to integrate a small measurement
data set during the reconstruction process.

Sample M1 shown in Fig. 7a is a rectangular step gauge.
A picture of fringe pattern through the reflection of M1 is
shown in Fig. 7b. The form data of the step gauge measured
by SPMD is shown in Fig. 8a. Meanwhile, we used a CMM
(ZEISS PRISMO) to measure the step gauge to compare
with the results of SPMD. Figure 8b shows the measurement difference between the two techniques, using h21, h31,
and h41 to represent the distance between the second step
and the first step, the distance between the third step and the
first step, and the distance between the fourth step and the
first step respectively, as shown in Fig. 7a. Table 1 shows a
comparison between SPMD and CMM by measuring sample M1. Step distances h21, h31, and h41 measured by CMM
are 2994.6 µm, 6921.0 µm, and 11863.0 µm, respectively.
The step distances measured by SPMD are 3011.7 µm,
6928.9 µm, and 11852.8 µm, respectively. The differences
between the two techniques in the measurement of h21, h31,

and h41 are 17.1 µm, 7.9 µm, and −10.2 µm, respectively.
Sample M2 shown in Fig. 7a is a specular mirror with three
circular steps. Figure 7c is a picture of the sample with
deformed fringe information. Figure 8c shows measurement
result of the sample by SPMD. Measurement difference of
the circular step gauge by SPMD and CMM is shown in
Fig. 8d. The distances from three circular steps to the circular base of the mirror are denoted as h1, h2 , and h3 respectively, as shown in Fig. 7a. Table 2 shows a comparison
between SPMD and CMM by measuring sample M2. Step
distances h1, h2 , and h3 measured by CMM are 5617.0 µm,
4671.8 µm, and 3675.6 µm, respectively. Results obtained
by SPMD are 5626.5 µm, 4660.7 µm, and 3682.1 µm, which
indicates that the differences between SPMD and CMM in
measuring the step distances are 9.5 µm, −11.1 µm, and
6.5 µm, respectively. Measurement results in Tables 1 and 2
show that the spatial positioning accuracy of SPMD is below
20 µm, which reflects the measurement accuracy of specular
structure positions.

3.2 Evaluation of form measurement accuracy
to an individual continuous segment
Sample M3 shown in Fig. 7a is a concave specular mirror
with four small concave features. Figure 7d shows a captured picture of the sample with fringe information. Figure 9a shows the spatial positioning data of a concave feature (enlarged in Fig. 7d) obtained by SPMD. Significant
measurement noises can be seen clearly in Fig. 9a. Form
information of the concave feature is hidden by these noises.
Then, the concave feature is separated from the whole part as
a continuous segment and reconstructed with gradient data.
The reconstructed result is shown in Fig. 9d, which clearly
displays the form of the concave feature. Figure 9b shows
the spatial positioning data of the mirror part within region
of interest (ROI) obtained by SPMD, where it is difficult to
distinguish the small concave features due to measurement
noise in the spatial positioning data. By contrast, the final
measurement result of the mirror part within ROI after data
fusion is shown in Fig. 9e, which can clearly display the
form of the whole mirror. A stylus profilometer (Formtracer
CS-5000CNC, Mitutoyo) with 70 nm measurement accuracy
is used to evaluate the form measurement accuracy of SPMD
to an individual continuous segment. An ideal concave is fitted based on measurement result of the stylus profilometer.

Root mean square (RMS) of the difference between the
spatial positioning data of SPMD and the fitted concave is
34.7 µm, as shown in Fig. 9c. In contract, Fig. 9f shows that
RMS of the difference between the reconstructed data of
SPMD and the fitted concave is 39.1 nm.

4 Discussion
The conceptual essence of SPMD is not only the concept
of segmentation but also the implementation of the “spatial
positioning” and “fusion strategy,” which enables SPMD
to collect both absolute spatial positioning data and gradient data, and integrate these two kinds of data into a whole
3D data. This solves the measurement limitation of current
PMD techniques while maintaining their advantages. Compared with GPMD, SPMD extends the measurement capability from continuous specular surfaces only to complex
structured specular surfaces. Meanwhile SPMD provides
much higher measurement accuracy compared with DPMD.
In the experiment of measuring a concave specular mirror
with four small concave features, we compared the spatial
positioning data obtained by SPMD and the reconstruction
data based on gradient data. Since the spatial positioning
accuracy of SPMD is in the same order of magnitude as the

lus profilometer in the measurement of the concave feature. d Reconstruction data of the concave feature obtained by SPMD. e Final

measurement accuracy of DPMD, the comparison can reflect
the difference between SPMD and DPMD. The experimental results show that SPMD’s spatial positioning accuracy
and form measurement accuracy to an individual continuous
segment are tens of micrometers and tens of nanometers
respectively, which indicates the accuracy of SPMD is nearly
1000 times higher than that of DPMD in a measurement of
continuous specular segments. This shows that SPMD has
obvious advantages over DPMD in the detection ability of
a specular surface with small curvature change. Like traditional PMD system, it is important to consider two main
factors that affect the measurement accuracy of SPMD.
One is calibration accuracy, which includes the calculation accuracy of imaging model parameters, the relationship between screen pixel coordinates and physical position
coordinates, and the spatial position relationship between
cameras and screen. Although scholars have developed several approaches to enhance the calibration accuracy of PMD
[17, 22, 30], further studies are still required to improve
measurement accuracy of SPMD. Besides calibration accuracy, phase error is another factor. This relates to a problem that we must consider in the process of measurement
— phase error caused by curvature of measured surface.
Because the curvature of a measured surface will blur the
collected fringe pattern to a certain extent, which results in
the increase of phase error, the accuracy of SPMD could be
relatively reduced when measuring a specular surface with
large curvature change. One way to solve this problem is to
increase the depth of field (DOF) of the imaging sensors. In
short, we believe that with the improvement of calibration
accuracy and phase accuracy of SPMD in the future, its spatial positioning accuracy and form measurement accuracy to
an individual continuous segment will be further improved.
The measurement speed of SPMD depends on the number of fringe images needed for a complete measurement
and the interval time between adjacent image captures.
The applied phase calculation methods determine how
many fringe images are needed. The interval time between
adjacent pattern captures is affected by the display speed
of the screen and the capture speed of the imaging sensor.
In our measurement, an imaging sensor takes 240 images
(including 120 horizontal fringe patterns and 120 vertical
fringe patterns) for a complete measurement. In fact, the
image number can be reduced according to measurement
requirements (e.g., single-shot PMD has been studied in
literature [11, 31]). The imaging sensor used in the experiment has a speed of 12 frames per second. Theoretically
our system needs 20 s to complete the acquisition of 240
fringe images according to the imaging sensor speed.
However, because the screen has a relative low display
speed, the imaging sensors have to spend plenty of time
waiting for the screen to display a fringe pattern. The
resulting acquisition time for one measurement is around

2281

1 min. However, we believe that it is not a tough challenge
to improve the measurement speed of SPMD. Acquisition
time for one measurement could achieve around 1 s or possibly even faster in the future if high-speed imaging sensor
and screen are applied, and synchronization between them
is realized. Since measurement speed of SPMD can be
fast, there is no need to cooperate with heavy experimental
platform that required by traditional measurement system
(e.g., CMM and stylus profilometer) to reduce the impact
of vibration. This increases systematic flexibility so that
SPMD can be designed to a portable measurement system.
Compared with the existing measurement methods in
industry (e.g., CMM, stylus profilometer, and interferometry), our developed techniques differentiate SPMD from
these methods that enable structured specular surfaces to
be measured successfully with high accuracy and speed
in one setup. After a completed calibration, if the relative
position of components (i.e., imaging sensors and screen)
in the system remains unchanged, the subsequent measurement does not need to repeat the calibration process.
These significantly improve the convenience and ability of
measuring structured specular surfaces. In a SPMD configuration, only a fringe-displaying screen and two imaging sensors are required during a measurement process,
which allows the configuration to be designed to be very
compact. Note that this can reduce volume and weight
of the measurement system. Therefore, significant advantages can be shown in application scenarios where embedded measurements are required (e.g., a diamond turning
machine). Next step, the size of screen and imaging sensors will be further decreased and the configuration of
SPMD will be optimized to achieve a more compact system for embedded measurement.
In addition to accuracy and speed, some improvements
are required in SPMD. For example, currently the continuous segments are separated manually based on curvature
difference, which leads to a low accuracy of segment edge
selection and a difficulty to select segments with complex
shapes. Moreover, manual segmentation severely limits
the speed of measurement and calculation. However, we
believe that as more algorithms (e.g., image recognition
and matching algorithm, and artificial intelligence algorithm) are applied to assist the segmentation process in the
future, SPMD will be more automated, and finally achieve
the ambitious target of real-time measurement and display.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a technique named segmentation
phase measuring deflectometry which shows significant
advantages in measurement of structured specular surfaces
compared with traditional PMD techniques. We describe

concept “segmentation,” spatial positioning technique and
data fusion strategy in SPMD. By applying the developed
techniques, the proposed technique can successfully measure
3D form of structured specular surface. At the same time,
continuous form measurement accuracy of SPMD can keep
as good as traditional GPMD. Experiments verified measurement ability of this technique to measure structured
specular surfaces. Measurement accuracy, speed, and future
development of SPMD, and its advantages compared with
the existing measurement techniques in industry are discussed. Segmentation accuracy and speed are main factors
affecting the SPMD performance. An automatic, fast, and
accurate segmentation method will be explored in next step.
