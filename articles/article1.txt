principles of thermal deflectometry, its special challenges,
and illustrates its use with examples from the inspection
of industrially produced surfaces.

Abstract: Deflectometry is a full-field gradient technique
that lends itself very well to testing specular surfaces. It
uses the geometry of specular reflection to determine the
gradient of the surface under inspection. In consequence,
a necessary precondition to apply deflectometry is the
presence of at least partially specular reflection. Surfaces
with larger roughness have increasingly diffuse reflection
characteristics, making them inaccessible to usual deflectometry. However, many industrially relevant surfaces
exist that change their reflection characteristic during
production and processing. An example is metal sheets
that are used as car body parts. Whereas the molded but
otherwise raw metal sheets show a mostly diffuse reflection without sufficient specular reflection, the final car
body panels have a high specular reflectance due to the
lacquering. In consequence, it would be advantageous
to apply the same inspection approach both for the raw
material and for the final product. To solve this challenge,
specular reflection from rough surfaces can be achieved
using light with a larger wavelength, as the specular
reflectivity of a surface depends on the ratio of the surface roughness and the wavelength of the light applied.
Wavelengths in the thermal infrared range create enough
specular reflection to apply deflectometry on many visually rough metal surfaces. This contribution presents the

1 Introduction
This section presents the basic ingredients needed for
understanding the technique of deflectometry and appreciating the rationale for extending the wavelength range
into the infrared.

1.1 D
 eflectometry
When testing and/or measuring reflective objects, the
well-established technique of fringe projection [1] is not
available because there is not enough scattered light available to carry out measurements of the object geometry
by capturing the diffuse reflection of the object surface.
Ideal mirrors (which are very rare in practice) generate
no scattered light at all. This means that the surface of
a mirror cannot be measured directly by fringe projection. Still, the geometry of such surfaces is accessible to
indirect measurements: a known reference pattern and a
camera are placed in such a geometrical relationship with
the object to be tested that the camera can observe the
mirror image of the reference pattern ‘on’ the test object
[2–8]. Any slopes or slope changes of the object surface
will then reveal/encode themselves in displacements and
distortions of the recorded reference pattern, which can
readily be understood to represent the first derivatives of
the test surface. This means also that both partial derivatives are needed to reconstruct the actual surface shape
by integration if required [9–13]. As deflectometry has no
intrinsic sensitivity to the object distance and the integration problem is therefore underdetermined, additional
knowledge such as an additional point measurement or
data from an additional deflectometric measurement
must be used [4, 5, 10]. Another possibility to use the

deflectometric measurement is to just evaluate the deviation of the observed reflection from the reflection that an
error-free surface would show. In many cases, e.g. when
only the presence of geometrical surface deviations is of
interest rather than their actual geometry, a mathematical surface reconstruction and the associated calibration
effort can thus be avoided.
Whether or not a 3-D surface is to be reconstructed,
geometry information is required about the directions of
the rays that form the image of the reference pattern; in
other words, the unique relationship between coordinates
on the reference screen and camera pixels must be found
for each camera pixel. For objects that are specularly
reflective in the visible wavelength range, this process is
usually done by coding the screen pixels using a series of
fringe patterns, e.g. Gray codes and/or phase shifting [14]
combined with unwrapping techniques [15, 16]. To that
end, a series of images, which depicts all reference patterns of the code, is recorded with the same placement of
the surface, the screen, and the camera. Provided that the
measurement noise of the brightness in the recorded series
is low, a position uncertainty on the screen is obtained
that is at least good enough to discern single pixels and
far in the sub-pixel regime if phase-shifting techniques
are used. The principle is sketched in Figure 1.
A major advantage of deflectometry is its very high
measurement sensitivity to changes in the slope and the
shape of the surface. It can be shown that using standard
components from machine vision, it is possible to obtain
a slope resolution of tens of μrad or better and, in consequence, a height resolution of tens of nanometers or better
[7, 8]. This sensitivity is made possible by phase shifting
and can be enhanced further by increasing the distance
between reference pattern and object [2]. Such performance in the range of the wavelength of visible light is
especially remarkable, as deflectometry uses only principles from geometrical optics and does not consider any
effect of wave optics.
Nowadays, deflectometry is used as an industrial
inspection technology for a variety of objects, e.g. for
painted surfaces and cast parts in the automobile industry as well as for optical components, such as eyeglass
lenses or mirrors in astronomy. However, the applicability
of deflectometry is limited to surfaces with a sufficiently
high specular reflectivity. This restricts the scope of use, as
many industrially produced objects have a diffuse surface
during the initial production stages and become specular only later in the process. As the quality of a specular
product is assessed by deflectometry on the final product,
it would be adequate to use the same technique on the raw
object or with an intermediate processing status.

Figure 1: Measurement principle of phase-measuring deflectometry.
A series of fringe patterns is displayed as a reference on a screen
(e.g. a monitor), and the camera observes the specular reflection
of the fringe patterns by the surface under inspection. The shape
of the surface directly determines the recorded image. In consequence, distortions of the surface can be detected, and quantitative
reconstruction of the surface is feasible.

1.2 Surface roughness and reflectivity
The general applicability of deflectometry requires the
presence of at least a partially specular reflection at the
surface. In addition to the bulk properties of the material, the surface reflectivity is primarily influenced by the
roughness of the surface. The roughness is a parameter
of the microstructure, which can be a result of a machining process or just the raw state of the material’s surface.
Such microstructures are usually not resolved by a deflectometry setup, but the roughness, nonetheless, becomes
visible by the scattering of light, i.e. a significant proportion of diffuse reflection. This effect can be perceived as a
blurring of reflected structures (see Figure 2).
For the application of deflectometry, we want to minimize this undesirable effect (leading to partial or total loss
of the reflected-fringe contrast) and maximize the specular part of the reflection. Infrared deflectometry exploits

calibrated surface-roughness standards in the visible (wavelength
0.4–0.7 μm) and long-wave infrared (wavelength 8–14 μm) ranges.
The samples’ RMS surface roughness Rq is indicated for each area.

the fact that one of the quantities governing the scattering
properties is the wavelength of the reflected light.
A general model for the scattering of electromagnetic
waves on rough surfaces was described by Bennett and
Porteus in Ref. [17]. We can use a simplified version of this
model to quantify the influence factors of this effect. For
this, we assume that the incidence of the IR radiation is
in surface normal direction, the acceptance angle of the
sensor is very small and the height profile of the microstructure has a Gaussian distribution. With these assumptions, the model describes the ratio between the specular
reflectivity of the rough surface r and the reflectivity r0
of a perfectly smooth surface of the same material. The
simplified model depends only on the wavelength λ of the
reflected light and on the surface roughness, which is typically quantified by its root-mean-square roughness Rq:
ρ
− (4 πRq )2 / λ2
=e
ρ0

wavelengths as parameters, plotted with Eq. (1). The denoted wavelengths give the upper and lower boundaries for the reflectance in
the respective wavelength range, the visible range is drawn in light
blue, the IR range in light red.

(1)

For the applications considered here, the RMS roughness
Rq is in the range from tenths of micrometers up to a few
micrometers. In this range, the reflectivity for visible light
drops significantly. Figure 3 presents a quantitative plot
of reflectance vs. Rq from 0 up to 1 μm for different wavelength ranges. Using light of a longer wavelength in the
thermal infrared spectrum, we obtain specular reflection
on surfaces, which exhibit a diffuse optical appearance in
the visible light spectrum. A thorough study of IR reflectivities was presented in Ref. [18].
The mode of observation is not to be confused with
thermography, although similar cameras are used: thermography applications observe the radiation emitted from
the surface under inspection, whereas in IR deflectometry,
the surface is inspected indirectly using the IR radiation
(light) from a dedicated pattern that is reflected at that
surface. As such, we do not observe the temperature of the
object itself, but we use it as a mirror in which we observe
the temperature of the reference screen.

1.3 T
 hermal cameras
For practical applications, the wavelength that can be
used is limited by the available technology. The key component here is the camera for the deflectometric sensor.
The increase in specularity with wavelength can be demonstrated even for a wavelength increase in the visible
spectrum; however, the maximum effect with available
technology can be attained in the long wavelength infrared spectrum (LWIR). This part of the spectrum is covered

by thermal imaging cameras with either cooled photonic
sensors or uncooled microbolometer sensors. While photonic sensors offer higher frame rates and better sensitivity and are available for a larger choice of spectral ranges,
microbolometer sensors are commonly used because they
are more affordable and offer a slightly wider spectral sensitivity range in the LWIR spectrum (8–14 μm).
A future advantage of microbolometer technology is
its increased use in applications, like sensors for the automotive sector, which provides for a broader availability of
this technology and the prospect of decreasing costs in the
future.
A drawback of the thermal infrared spectrum comes
with the diffraction limit imposed by the longer wavelength, which limits the maximal achievable resolution
of the deflectometry system. The point image is, hence,
larger by about an order of magnitude; on the other hand,
the pixels of microbolometer cameras are also larger than
the pixels for VIS cameras by the same ratio, so that the
distinctly lower sensor resolutions (e.g. 640 × 480 pixels)
are physically well founded and adequate.
Constant improvements in thermal imaging technology in the last years have gradually enabled practical
applications for infrared deflectometry. In terms of image
resolution and frame rates, the performance of thermal
infrared cameras is now almost comparable with conventional cameras [19].
Especially the inspection of raw metal (as flat sheets
or molded parts) is an interesting application for IR
deflectometry. The roughness of such materials is usually
beyond the specular range for the visible spectrum, but
well within it for the LWIR spectrum. An additional benefit

380

S. Höfer et al.: Infrared deflectometry for diffusely specular surfaces

apart from the robustness against surface roughness is
that all metals exhibit an increased reflectivity at longer
wavelength. Also, IR deflectometry has found applications
in optics fabrication, especially aspherics. Large time and
cost savings are possible when mirrors can be inspected
as mirrors even during the grinding stage [20]. The better
the pre-figuring, the less time will be spent polishing with
very low material removal rates. Glass can easily be tested
with IR deflectometry because the often disturbing rearside reflection [21] is absent: glass becomes opaque in the
infrared. This is particularly important as the option of
grinding the rear surface for removing the extra reflection
would, of course, no longer work.

2 T
 hermal patterns
While the camera technology for a deflectometry sensor is
commercially available in the form of thermal IR cameras,
there is effectively no suitable technology for generating
dynamic thermal patterns in the way a monitor or projector serves the purpose of pattern generation for the visible
light spectrum. Recent development in the field of IR
deflectometry is, therefore, focused on devising dedicated
methods for position encoding with thermal patterns and
the evaluation of the acquired heat images.
Formerly, the development of thermal pattern generators was restricted to specialized and very expensive equipment for military applications. The need for hardware test
equipment for heat seeking missiles or thermal imagers
led to a variety of approaches to simulate dynamic infrared scenes by means of emissive, transmissive, or reflective methods, or with laser scanners. Williams gives an
extensive overview of the technologies that emerged from
this research in Ref. [22]. Today, the prevailing technology
in this field is based on microresistor arrays that create
thermal patterns pixel-wise by heating resistors electrically on a chip-scale display.
Unfortunately, apart from being virtually unavailable for civil purposes, these infrared scene simulators
are unsuitable for usage in a deflectometry setup. The
test equipment usually features only a chip-sized display
or a low-power projector directly coupled to the sensor
under test. Deflectometry, however, requires a large,
ideally planar pattern display. Therefore, in this section,
we discuss different pattern-generation methods that are
suitable for IR deflectometry.
The challenge in IR deflectometry is to create a spatial
and temporal modulation of the thermal pattern with the
highest possible contrast. It is fairly easy to create a light

source for the LWIR spectrum by means of a heat source,
and as the sensitivity of typical IR cameras peaks around
room temperature, it can be done safely without high-temperature sources. But heat transfer by conduction, convection, or radiation makes it challenging to maintain cooler
areas right next to a heat source to achieve high-contrast
patterns. As typical techniques for position coding require
a series of different patterns, the necessary temporal modulation of the pattern can complicate things further.

2.1 S
 tatic patterns
A proven method for the generation of thermal patterns
is static patterns. Instead of using regions of different
temperature, most methods modulate the emitted infrared radiation by using regions of different emissivity,
reflectance, or transmittance. The fact that static patterns
cannot be temporally modulated/modified is no exclusion criterion for their use in IR deflectometry. Almost all
coding methods for deflectometry use some kind of stripe
pattern that is shifted linearly or rotated. The possibility
to implement this method with a physically stationary
monitor in the visible is simply an addition of convenience
in this context, not a necessity.
2.1.1 Moving emissivity-coded screens
Figure 4 shows an example for a high-contrast static
pattern with differing surface emissivity. While the copper
plate is evenly heated to the same temperature, regions
with the exposed metal appear cool to the thermal infrared camera due to the near-zero emissivity of the metal.
However, the imprinted pattern with significantly higher
emissivity shows the actual temperature of the surface.
Of course, temporally varying patterns can also be
created and recorded by mechanically moving a static
pattern. This method was first used by Kammel and
Horbach in Ref. [23] to implement position encoding with a
single phase-shifted binary pattern, which demonstrated
for the first time the applicability of IR deflectometry on
unpainted car body parts. Surface defects were detected
with a simple evaluation based on the contrast and modulation information of the phase-shifted pattern. Figure 5
shows an embodiment of the technique.
In a similar experiment in Ref. [24], a full phase-shift
code sequence was obtained by shifting and rotating
multiple static sine patterns. In this case, the application
was the surface inspection of transparent materials that
become opaque in the far infrared spectrum, so that artifacts from multiple reflections can be avoided.

radiation.

pattern that is translated in steps of a quarter of its period to implement a simple phase-shifting method. The low-emissivity carrier
metal is aluminum in this case.

A disadvantage of this approach is that care has to be
taken where the reflection of the object is directed. If the
measurement setup is not designed carefully, heat sources
in the surroundings, such as the camera itself, end up as
ghost images superimposing the images taken by the IR
camera.

2.1.2 Radiating hot wire
Another successful approach with static patterns was
demonstrated in the inspection of unpolished astronomical telescope mirrors during the grinding stage [20], where
a scanning hot wire is used as an IR line light source. To
implement the position encoding, the wire is moved with
a motorized stage horizontally and vertically. The wire as
IR light source has the advantage that it can be suspended
in free air and heated to high temperatures in order to
create a high-contrast pattern in the IR spectrum. At the

same time, a single-line pattern entails the disadvantage
that many frames have to be acquired to sample the whole
surface, so that the frame rate of the camera sets a lower
boundary for the total measurement time.
To obtain position coding with this approach, the
scanned line pattern has to be located accurately in the
camera images. A robust method is to calculate the centroid of the intensity for each pixel over a sequence of
images [25]. If the movement of the line pattern is slow
enough, each camera pixel takes multiple intensity measurements of the passing line profile from which the position of its center can be obtained. This gives an instant of
maximum intensity for each pixel and, given the corresponding position of the line pattern, a position encoding
between camera and pattern.
The heated-wire concept was later adapted for the
inspection of arbitrary surfaces in a scanning sensor
setup [26]. Here, the movement is restricted to only one
direction, and only partial position coding is obtained,
but at the same time, the scanning approach enables the
inspection of large-scale surfaces or inline inspection of
linearly moving objects. It was also shown that for fastmoving line patterns, e.g. at a setup for inline inspection, or on surfaces that distort the reflected pattern
significantly, an actual line detection (as opposed to
centroiding) can obtain better results. A new tensorbased method was introduced in Ref. [26] that performs
a subpixel-accurate line detection for each image and
interpolates the movement of the pattern between
single frames.
This method was used with the setups shown in
Figure 6, also in connection with a heated wire as pattern
source. Figure 6A shows the concept as a robot-mounted
version of the sensor, which provides a flexible way to
inspect large-scale surfaces of arbitrary geometry by scanning them in a continuous path. The reverse concept is

shown in Figure 6B where the object to be inspected is
moving, e.g. on a conveyor belt, and is inspected while
passing under the fixed mounted sensor.

2.2 D
 ynamic patterns
Another approach for realizing position encoding is to
create planar thermal patterns dynamically, as a display
screen for the thermal infrared spectrum, so to speak. As
previously mentioned, the difficulty lies in creating and
maintaining a high temperature difference in a small
space, which is necessary for a high-contrast pattern.
Unfortunately, the existing approaches to generate static patterns in IR deflectometry, e.g. modulating
emissive, reflective, or transmissive material properties,
cannot be applied to generate dynamic patterns. Common
methods for dynamic patterns from the visible spectrum,
like LED, LCD, or CRT technologies, are also not viable for
the thermal IR spectrum [27] or, in case of digital micromirror devices, would need extensive redesign to be applicable [22].
For a display based on regions with a different temperature, heat diffusion leads to fading of the pattern and
cross-talk between neighboring regions. Moreover, the
energy required to change the displayed pattern increases
significantly with the size of the display area as it has to be
heated up or cooled down. Therefore, such displays need
careful design.
For IR deflectometry, two new methods for creating
dynamic patterns have been tested by the authors: pattern
generation with large-scale resistor arrays (as opposed to
specialized arrays with pixel pitches of several tens of μm

[28] and luminosities insufficient for deflectometry) and
surface heating with laser radiation.

2.2.1 Resistor arrays
Displays based on resistor arrays use the heat dissipation
in resistors as IR source. By arranging the resistors in a
grid pattern and controlling the electrical current for each
resistor individually, a display for the IR spectrum can be
realized that allows the display of arbitrary pixel images.
This method was already proposed in Ref. [27] and implemented on a small scale in Ref. [24].
Figure 7 shows a resistor array setup and the resulting image in the LWIR spectrum. Tiling such arrays makes
displays of arbitrary size possible. The challenges of this
design lie in the practical implementation. Problems like
the heat transfer through the base material, and cooling
of the display when pixels are switched off, have to be
solved, and a glance at the aforementioned microresistor arrays shows that this requires extensive engineering efforts even at small scales. While resistor arrays are
definitely a viable technology for application in IR deflectometry, their design and operation becomes complex for
higher frame rates and pixel densities.

2.2.2 Laser-heated screens
Another approach is to use laser heating for creating
thermal IR displays, which has been demonstrated in
Ref. [29]. By using a powerful laser with a mirror scanner,
regions on a projection surface can be heated locally with

S. Höfer et al.: Infrared deflectometry for diffusely specular surfaces

the current flowing through each resistor individually, arbitrary pixel images can be displayed.

the aim that the resulting heat signature represents the
desired pattern. This way, off-the-shelf laser hardware can
be used to create large-scale thermal patterns. Unlike conventional projections, the laser light is mostly absorbed
and heats the surface instead of being scattered. Still,
there must be no direct reflections of the laser beam into
the IR camera, as the intensity is high enough to destroy
the camera sensor.
The drawback of this method is that the pattern
buildup is not instantaneous. Already written parts of the
pattern slowly diffuse and cool down while the laser is
still working.
Figure 8A shows a laboratory setup with a conventional laser system as used for laser processing, where the
laser beam is steered by a mirror scanner. The projection
screen takes the role of the pattern display, and the setup
with the camera observing the reflection of the pattern in
the surface under test represents a deflectometry setup.
Figure 8B shows several snapshots of the resulting pattern
on the screen, where the current position of the laser spot
is clearly visible. To achieve position coding with such
a fading pattern, the camera records a video sequence
during the writing process. From the current position of
the laser spot in each frame of the sequence and the corresponding known position of the laser on the projection
screen, a rough position encoding can be obtained. This
can be extended with a model of the projection surface’s
thermodynamic behavior to interpolate the laser position even between single frames and get a more precise
position decoding. Following the time arrow in Figure 8B
allows building accurate cooling curves. Eventually, a
complete pattern can be built up from all recorded frames
as in Figure 8C.

The advantage of this method is that it can easily be
scaled up to large projection surfaces, but at the cost of
longer build up times for the pattern. This could be compensated by increasing the laser’s power output to maintain the pattern contrast at higher write speeds.

 pplications
3.1 Sensitive defect detection on visually
diffuse objects
The target application for most developments in IR deflectometry is the inspection of objects with raw metal surfaces
in the steel or automotive industry. While there are many
options to perform IR deflectometry with the previously
shown methods, a lightweight and mobile setup is preferable, which is why the scanning setup from Figure 6A has
proven to be the most versatile one for this application.
Figure 9 shows the result from scanning a car body sheet
as a fused image from multiple scan lines (line pitch in
scan direction: 2 mm) and the derived local gradients of
the surface. The surface has been scanned vertically and
horizontally to obtain both gradients, but only one fringe
image is shown here.
The defects in Figure 9A are usually only visible by
manual inspection after honing the surface with a dressing stone. Not so in deflectometry: defects appear as
minima and maxima in the gradient image and can easily
be detected. The actual depth of the defects ranges from
50 μm to 400 μm, as determined both by the integration

to right under the sensor, which was fixed over the transport mechanism.

of the deflectometric gradient maps and cross-checks with
a focusing microscope.
Another possible setup for a scanning IR deflectometry sensor is to use it for inline inspection where the objects
to be inspected are already moving, e.g. on a conveyor belt
during manufacturing. The objects are inspected while
passing the sensor, provided the surface geometry is
accessible from a static position of the camera. A result
that was acquired with the scanning setup from Figure 6B
on a predominantly flat car body part with a raw metal
surface is shown in Figure 10. The image shows the local
change in the measured gradients where surface defects,
such as dents in the material, and edges in the geometry
stand out as sudden changes.
When custom building the pattern generators cannot
be avoided, one weakness of IR deflectometry (not having
programmable off-the-shelf display screens available)
turns into a strength: the pattern generators can be made
to the specifications of the task, including for dedicated
surface shapes and/or large object sizes.

3.2 Optics figure measurements in
­preliminary processing stages
Besides the benefit of IR deflectometry to enable measurements of visually rough surfaces, an additional advantage materializes in the surface inspection of transparent
parts. Materials like glass and many transparent plastics
are nearly completely transmissive in the visible light
spectrum, but become opaque in the LWIR spectrum

(which is why IR imaging optics use Germanium lenses,
being opaque in the visible but transparent in the IR). As
referenced above in Refs. [20, 25], it is, therefore, possible
to measure glass optics that is ground on both sides but
still reflective in the IR. Whether the tested surfaces are
ground or polished, the parasitic rear-side reflection does
not occur. One example of this is shown in Figure 11.
In Figure 11A, front and rear side reflection patterns
are visible, and scratched/scuffed areas in the center
stand out clearly. In Figure 11B, only the front-side reflection appears; the scuffed areas are still visible, which
means that their depth is a significant proportion of the
IR wavelength. Also, the IR image is less sharp because of
the reduced resolution due to both wavelength and pixel
resolution of IR cameras, which was discussed above.

4 Summary
Current developments in IR deflectometry show that it has
grown from first proofs of concept to a viable method for
surface inspection. Especially its applicability on surfaces
that are difficult to inspect, such as diffusely specular surfaces or materials that are transparent in the visible spectrum, makes it stand out among other optical inspection
methods. The highest demand for IR deflectometry is currently for the inspection of raw metal surfaces primarily
in the car industry. However, other applications already
realized, like the inspection of telescope mirrors in early
production stages, show that there are many fields where

the particular advantages of IR deflectometry make it
uniquely suitable for the task.
IR deflectometry enables the application of established methods and algorithms from conventional (visible
spectrum) deflectometry to broaden the range of surfaces
and materials that can be tested. Even though the generation of thermal patterns currently enforces significantly
different setup concepts for thermal-infrared deflectometric sensors, the developments have led to new ways of
doing deflectometry, like the scanning of surfaces, which
enables new and relevant applications.
