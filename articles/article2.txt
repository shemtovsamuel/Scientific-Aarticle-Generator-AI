ABSTRACT
We propose a new concept of a deflectometer, aimed to provide high accuracy measurements with high sampling rate and
low noise, as required by state-of-the-art slope-measuring profilometers, like Long Trace Profilometers or Nanometer Optics
Measuring instruments. For this purpose, we introduce certain modifications to the usual working principle of autocollimators
so that the measured angle is not given by the displacement of the pattern captured by a CCD, but by the harmonic contents of
the time-modulated intensity signal acquired by a photodiode. By doing this, the signal can be sampled not by just a few thousand
pixels but by millions of samples/s.

I. INTRODUCTION
The availability of long, smooth, figured mirrors, with surface errors in the order of 1 nm and below, is essential for
the efficient exploitation of modern x-ray sources, like free
electron lasers, and low emittance storage rings.1–3 The development of deterministic polishing techniques4,5 and the latest
advances in ultra-high accuracy metrology have pushed manufacturing of state-of-the-art mirrors to surface errors about
a fraction of a nanometer in optical lengths up to 1 m, for a
variety of mirror figures ranging from flat to curvatures as
short as 10 m.
Among the most accurate metrology systems capable of
characterizing long optical x-ray mirrors, one finds the Long
Trace Profilometer (LTP)6,7 the Nanometer Optics Measuring instrument (NOM),8 which has become popular across the
different metrology laboratories of x-ray source facilities.9–12
In a previous study,11 we determined that the optical sensor, an electronic autocollimator, was the largest source of
random errors, with a noise in the order of 100 nrad rms
at acquisition rates of 25 samples/s. Although these errors
can be reduced by averaging, this implies increasing the measurement time, making the measurements more sensitive to

slow drifts. Moreover, some operations like adaptive optics
characterization13–16 or error removal techniques17–19 already
require multiple scans per mirror, making it even more important to have low noise and fast acquisition rates.
In this work, we propose a novel concept of the deflectometer, aiming to provide an alternative optical sensor to
be used in scanning slope measuring instruments like the
NOM. The goal of the proposed concept is to provide an
angle measuring system, capable of working at variable working distance from the sample, with a small probe beam, as low
noise as possible, and a fast acquisition time while preserving the simplicity of an optical autocollimator as well as its
accuracy.
The system we propose allows encoding the angle in a
time-modulated periodic signal, in contrast to the usual autocollimators that encode the angle in a spatial distribution of
intensity (an image of a reticle, with a few fringes) detected
by a CCD. The advantages of the time-encoding that can be
exploited are two. On the one side, the time signal can be sampled at a very high rate, several millions of samples/s, compared to the few thousand pixels of a CCD. On the other side,
the signal consists of a periodic function that can have hundreds or thousands of periods per sampled dataset, instead

of just a few fringes as is the case of the reticle image at the
detector plane of an autocollimator.

II. MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLE
The principle we propose in this work consists in replacing the 1D or 2D detector of the autocollimator by an area
detector (a photodiode) and to introduce a periodic modulation of the probe beam in order to obtain a time-dependent
variation of the intensity detected by the diode. Of course,
the waveform of this intensity signal must depend on the
angle to be measured. There is a variety of optical components that can be used to introduce the desired modulation,
ranging from piezoelectric actuated mirrors, to electrooptic
modulators. Depending on the component used, modulation
frequencies in the range from a few hundred Hz to the many
MHz can be reached. In general, higher modulation frequencies allow measuring angles with a lower noise level and a
higher acquisition rate but require more complex detection
and processing electronics.
We demonstrate the proposed method using an optical
setup in which the modulation is introduced by a piezoelectric actuated mirror, at a frequency of 312 Hz. For the piezoelectric actuator we use, this frequency provides a good balance between the diameter of the mirror we need to accept
the beam, and the amplitude of oscillations it introduces. The
scheme of the proposed setup is shown in Fig. 1. A fibercoupled laser is focused onto a 50 µm pinhole, which constitutes the source for the instrument. Downstream the pinhole,
the beam crosses a polarizing beam splitter and is reflected
back by a small flat mirror. The orientation of the mirror is
controlled by a piezoelectric actuator that introduces an oscillation of the beam direction before it actually goes to the beam
splitter and subsequently to a collimating lens with a focal
length of 200 mm. The diameter of the collimated beam is
2 mm. It is then reflected back by the target mirror, and the
same lens focuses it onto a transmission grating. In order to
optimize the intensity of light that is actually reaching the
detector, we use some polarization controlling optics, like
waveplates and polarizers. The grating is placed at the focal

plane of the lens, so the position of the spot on the grating
measures the angle of the incoming beam. The grating period
is 100 µm, which is comparable to the spot size. Thus, when the
spot oscillates, according to the modulation introduced by the
piezo, it is more or less occluded by the grating. This results
in a periodic variation of the intensity transmitted by the grating, which is measured by a photodiode behind the grating.
The effect is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows actual images
of the focused spot as seen from behind the grating, and
the corresponding value of intensity in the time-modulated
signal.
The fundamental frequency of the intensity oscillation
is given by the oscillation frequency of the piezoelectric
transducer. The form of the wave, however, depends on the

detector. The different positions (a)–(c) of the spot across the period of the grating,
correspond to the different values of intensity along the period of the time signal

deflection angle (α) introduced by the mirror under test. Since
the intensity function is a periodic time-dependent function,
with a limited number of significant harmonics, it can be fully
characterized by the amplitude and phase of a few coefficients of its Fourier series. These coefficients can be efficiently
determined, with very low noise and high accuracy, by means
of synchronous detection. The number of harmonics present
in the intensity signal depends on the amplitude of the piezoelectric oscillation. The wider these oscillations are, the more
harmonics are present in the intensity signal. On the other
hand, a very small oscillation would lead to a very weak modulation and to a noisier measurement. Similarly, a strong curvature of the surface under test would defocus the spot at the
grating plane, which would equally reduce the contrast of the
intensity modulation, too.
In our setup, the piezoelectric transducer introduces a
relatively low frequency modulation signal, with the fundamental frequency f 0 set to 312 Hz. In this regime, it is simple to digitize the intensity signal x(t, α) using an analog-todigital converter (ADC). This digital signal can be numerically
treated to obtain the Fourier coefficients Xn (α) by computing
the following integral:

Xn (α) =

x(t, α)exp(i2πnf0 t)dt.

Here, T is the integration period, and n indicates the harmonic
number. Xn (α) is a complex valued function of the deflection
angle introduced by the mirror under test. Alternatively, one
can obtain the amplitude and phase of Xn (α) directly using a
lock-in amplifier, which would allow treating signals up to the
MHz modulation range.
Figure 3 illustrates the dependence between the time
signal and its harmonic composition for three different values of the angle under test. One can see that the waveform
of the function depends on the angle and so does the harmonics (amplitude and phase) of the corresponding spectrum.
This dependence repeats when the angle introduces a displacement of the spot equivalent to one period of the grating. Thus, the dependence is angle-periodic with a period α0
given by the period (P) of the transmission grating and the
focal distance (F) of the FT lens, according to the following
formula:
α0 =

P
.
2F

Consequently, since Xn (α) are a set of angle-periodic
functions, with period α0 , they can be written as a Fourier
series. In other words, they can be expressed as a linear combination of sines and cosines of the deflection angle and its
integer multiples. Using complex notation, this is written as

FIG. 3. Intensity signal, as measured by
the photodiode, and the corresponding
frequency spectrum for three different
angles of the mirror under test. One can
see that the waveform changes, as well
as the corresponding harmonic composition.

Here Xnp represents the series of complex Fourier
coefficients for the nth harmonic function Xn (α), p being the
harmonic number of the series. In general, Eq. (3) can be truncated to a finite harmonic, so it becomes a regular algebraic
equation.
To determine the values of the coefficients Xnp , the
instrument must be calibrated against an independent angle
measuring device. To do this, one needs to measure simultaneously α and Xn (α) and use these values to solve Xnp by
least square fitting. Once the coefficients Xnp are determined,
the matrix can be inverted to express the deflection angle as a
function of the measured values of Xn as follows:

square minimization. The estimated values of these coefficients, together with the actual value of α0 determine the
calibration of the instrument. Once the coefficients Xnp are
determined, one can use them to approximate the actual
dependence of the measured values Xn on the deflection angle.
This is shown in Fig. 5, where the plots represent the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of X1 and X2 on the
measurement angle, in a range of 1 mrad. The dots correspond to measured values, while the solid lines correspond
to the approximation given by the calibration parameters.
As expected, the dependence function is periodic and has a
period of 246.3 µrad. It corresponds to the period given by
Eq. (2), for a 100 µm grating period and an effective focal length
of 203 mm. This period depends only on the grating and the
lens, so it is independent of the surface under test, the modulation frequency, or the modulation amplitude. This allows for
a stable calibration of the instrument. One can also see that the
measured values are well approximated by the fitting function,
which indicates the accuracy of the calibration. There are,
however, small differences caused by deviations from perfect
periodicity of the grating transmission.

The proposed method has been tested in the laboratory.
A picture of the setup used for the experiment is shown in
Fig. 4. One can observe three main components: the deflectometer being calibrated, an angle measuring interferometer
(Renishaw ML10), and a rotary stage (Huber 410) that supports
the target mirror and the interferometer retroreflectors. The
deflectometer is built according to the layout shown in Fig. 1.
It points to a flat mirror (target) installed on the platform
of the rotary stage together with the retroreflectors of the
interferometer. This allows the angle measuring interferometer checking the same angle variation as the deflectometer
when the rotary stage is scanned.
In order to perform the calibration, an angular range of
the rotary stage is scanned. The angle measured by the interferometer and the values of the harmonics Xn are recorded at
each position. Taking these values, one can use the expression in Eq. (3) to fit the coefficients Xnp , by simple linear least

Once the system is calibrated, one can use the expression
in Eq. (4) to measure angles with the deflectometer. In order to
check its performance, we have compared its measurements
with those taken by the angle measuring interferometer.
Figure 6 shows the differences between the measurements
of the two instruments, measured in the calibration range
(1 mrad). The amplitude of the error is of the order of 0.25 µrad
rms and corresponds to an acquisition rate of 100 ms, using a
modulation frequency of 312 Hz. The error is rather uniform,
which indicates that the deflectometer is actually capable of
measuring angles and that the above given expressions are
capable of decoding the measured values Xn onto an actual
measure of the deflection angle.
The residual error is contributed by random errors,
mostly electronic noise of the detector and air turbulences,
as well as by systematic error. Nevertheless, systematic errors
can be reduced by calibration, as long as they are repeatable.
By doing this, the sensitivity of the instrument is essentially
limited by random errors.
Figure 7 represents the repeatability error of the deflectometer. The repeatability evaluation is performed by keeping
the rotary stage at a fixed position, while the angle is continuously measured with both the deflectometer and interferometer. The whole setup is enclosed to reduce air turbulences.
The difference between both measurements is registered at
every point. One can see that the differences are in the order
of 0.130 µrad rms. This value integrates both the measurement noise of the deflectometer, and that of the interferometer, as well as the fluctuations introduced by air turbulences
along the optical path of the measurements. While the noise of
the instrument is mostly white noise, with equal contribution
of low and high frequencies, low frequencies are dominated
by very low air turbulences within the setup enclosure. This
result confirms the validity of the detection principle, keeping
in mind that it corresponds to a very modest modulation frequency of the deflectometer, with only 31 periods integrated
per measurement. As already stated in the introduction, the

detection system can be implemented at much higher frequencies, which is expected to result in a much lower noise
level.

IV. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE
In this work, we propose a novel detection system to
measure deflection angles with very low noise at a fast acquisition rate. It consists in encoding the deflection angle in
the harmonic structure of a periodic time-dependent signal.
This allows for synchronous detection, taking advantage of the
inherent noise robustness it provides.
We propose an optical setup which operates under
this principle. A method is described to calibrate and to
extract the angle values, once the instrument has been calibrated. Laboratory measurements confirm the validity of
the method and achieve repeatability error in the order of
130 nrad.
Variations of the optical setup are possible. In particular,
one can reach higher angular resolution, at the expense of a
wider probe beam. For instance, using a larger focal length
FT lens would increase angular resolution proportionally to
the increase in the diameter of the probe beam. A smaller
source, more divergent, and a finer grating would also improve
the angular resolution at the expense of the lateral resolution of the instrument. An optimization in terms of mechanical
stability may also be required.
The obtained result indicates that a much better performance can be obtained by increasing the frequency of the
beam modulation. To do this, one can use photoelastic modulators, electrooptic modulators, or even a simple heterodyne
laser. These optical components allow modulating the beam at
the kHz or MHz range, providing a much higher noise reduction with even faster acquisition rates. Although in that case,
the detection and data processing require more sophisticated
electronics, a noise level in the order of few nrad will be
achievable.
